# IAM.3.05 - Administrator access to Production

## Control Statement
Administrator access to the production system is granted based on job roles and responsibilities and limited to authorized personnel.

## Context
Administrator Access is defined as a level of access above that of a normal user. Use of Administrator Access should be consistent with an individualâ€™s role or job responsibilities at GitLab. When a team member's role or job responsibilities change, their Administrator Access should be appropriately updated or removed. In situations where it is unclear whether a particular action is appropriate, and within the scope of current job responsibilities, the situation should be discussed with management. The spirit of this control is to ensure there's a process in place so that all additions and updates to the production environment, are appropriately reviewed and approved before being merged.


## Scope
This control applies to any system or process where source code can be modified.

## Ownership
Control owner:
 * Engineering
 * Infrastructure

Process owner:
 * Infrastructure Team
 * All engineering teams
 * IT-Ops

## Guidance
* Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with role-based access scheme that organizes information system and network privileges into roles
* Track and monitor privileged role assignments.
* Priveleged access to production is granted only after review and approval by manager
* Implement separation of duties through assigned information system access authorizations


### Possible evidence an auditor would request
* Handbook links and other relevant documentation and links
* Policy and Process documents proving that Administrator access to the production system is granted based on job roles and responsibilities and limited to authorized personnel.
* Example - Merge requests or templates showing authorized access and appropriate approval.
