# Encryption Policy

Encryption is a process in which data is encoded so that it remains hidden from or inaccessible to unauthorized users. It helps securely protect data that you don't want anyone to have access to. By encrypting our data at rest and in transit, we can better protect private, proprietary and sensitive data and can enhance the security of communication between client applications and servers.

## Scope

This control is applicable to the [production environment](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/) and any end user devices that store such data. The production environment includes all endpoints and cloud assets used in hosting GitLab.com and its subdomains. This may also include third-party systems that support the business of GitLab.com

## Encryption at Rest

Data at rest is defined as data that is physically stored and not actively moving from one location to another (i.e.: device to device or network to network). This includes data stored on laptops, flash drives and hard drives.

**Encryption Method**

GitLab encrypts data at rest using a variety of tools including:
* Utilizing [Google Cloud’s Technology](https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption-at-rest) which encrypts data at rest by default. Encyption keys are managed by Google.
* Company laptops are encrypted per the [laptop or desktop system configuration](/handbook/security/#best-practices)
* Conducting [third party vendor security reviews](/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/third-party-vendor-security-review.html) which includes a review of encryption methods utilized by our third party vendors where applicable.

## Encryption in Transit

Data in transit is defined as data that is actively moving from one location to another (i.e: device to device or network to network). This includes data transferred over public networks such as the internet.

**Encryption Method**

GitLab encrypts data in transit using a variety of tools including:
* TLS Strict (SSL-Only Origin Pull), Always Use HTTPS, Universal SSL enabled through [Cloudflare](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/01/16/gitlab-changes-to-cloudflare/)
* Utilizing [Google Cloud’s Tecnology](https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption-in-transit) which encrypts data in transit by default. Encryption keys are managed by Google.
* Conducting [third party vendor security reviews](/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/third-party-vendor-security-review.html) which includes a review of encryption methods utilized by our third party vendors where applicable.

## Rolling your own Crypto

Please don’t roll your own crypto. If you really think you have a situation where it makes sense to do this, please don’t. If you really really think this is a good idea, it is still not and please don't. If you’re absolutely sure you have an edge case where this makes sense, please engage with the GitLab security team first so they can work with you on finding an alternative.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy require filling out an [exception request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/sec-compliance/compliance/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Exception%20Request.md).
