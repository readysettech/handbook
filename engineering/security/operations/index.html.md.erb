## Vision

Protect company property by identifying, preventing, detecting and responding to risks and security events targeting the business and GitLab.com and its users. We are at the forefront of GitLab's security.

## Mission

The Security Operations Sub-department focuses on the operational aspect of security. Our Sub-department consists of experienced breakers, builders, and defenders from all walks of life and geographic locations. We are responsible for improving GitLab's security capabilities and metrics in the areas of:

 * Realistic cyber attack scenarios against GitLab.com, company property, and employees - [Red Team](/handbook/engineering/security/red-team), [Issues Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/red-team)
 * Security anomaly/event detection and incident response - [SIRT - Security Incident Response Team](/handbook/engineering/security/sec-incident-response.html), [Issues Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/sirt)
 * Abuse of GitLab.com - [Trust & Safety](/handbook/engineering/security/operations/abuse), [Issues Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/trust-and-safety)
