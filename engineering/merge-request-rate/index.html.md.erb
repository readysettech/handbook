## Definition

MR Rate is a measure of productivity and efficiency. The numerator is a collection of merge requests to a set of projects. The denominator is a collection of people. Both are tracked over time (usually monthly).

## Terminology

For clarity, when referring to an MR rate, you must use the format: `[Identity] [Postfix] MR Rate`.

* `[Identity]` is collection of people (the denominator) and is usually a Division, Department, Sub-Department, or Team name from  our [Organizational Structure](/company/team/structure/#organizational-structure)
* The `[postfix]` defines the MRs that are counted
   * "Overall" means all the MRs to the project are counted, regardless of author
   * "Wider" means only MRs authored by non-GitLab team members are counted
   * "Narrow" means ony the MRs authored by members of the organization are counted

The reason we sometimes track the `Wider` rate is that MRs from our community take effort from one of our [coaches](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/) to merge, and we want to incentivize that behavior.

## Examples

A 5 member team in the past month has merged 200 MRs authored by team members, merged 100 MRs authored by other GitLab team members, and 50 MRs authored by people from the wider-community.

- The `Team Overall MR Rate` would be 70 (`350 / 5`)
- The `Team Narrow MR Rate` would be 40 (`200 / 5`)
- The `Team Wider MR Rate` would be 10 (`50 / 5`)
