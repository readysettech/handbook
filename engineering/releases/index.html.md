## Overview and terminology

* **Monthly self-managed release**: GitLab version (XX.YY.0) [published every month on the 22nd][process-monthly-release]. From this monthly release, [patch][process-patch-release], [non-critical][process-security-release-non-critical], and [critical][process-security-release-critical] security releases are created as needed
* **GitLab.com releases**: [Auto-deploy releases][process-auto-deploy-release] that are deployed from [auto-deploy branches created from master][auto-deploy], on regular intervals

The `self-managed release` is a collection of many successfully deployed `auto-deploy`
releases on GitLab.com.

**The main priority** of both types of releases **[is GitLab availability & security](/handbook/engineering/#prioritizing-technical-decisions)**
as an application running on both GitLab.com and for customers running GitLab
in their own infrastructure.

With these two types of releases, GitLab Inc. has to balance _at the same time_
the workflows normally found in SaaS companies with the ones found in companies
that publish packaged software.

## GitLab.com releases

GitLab.com receives regular updates according to our [auto-deploy schedule](#gitlabcom-releases-1).
This means that GitLab.com **lives in the now** and [semver] versioning used by self-managed
installations does not apply to it.

For example, developers might be working in the `12.3` milestone on items that
will be a part of `12.3.0` release but GitLab.com will only "know" of the commit
SHA that the developer created.

Users on GitLab.com therefore receive features and bug fixes earlier than
users of self-managed installations.

## Self-managed releases

The `self-managed release` is a [semver] versioned package of features that
are already released on GitLab.com through `auto-deploys`.
This means that the official published version of GitLab is a **historical
snapshot** of items that are released to users on GitLab.com. As such,
the `self-managed release` is created from a _backport_ branch named by the
targeted semver version with a stable suffix, eg. `12-3-stable`.

Self-managed users receive features and bug fixes only after a new [semver]
version is created and published.

Our [maintenance policy] describes in detail the cadence of our major, minor and patch releases for self-managed users. The major release yearly cadence was defined [after an all stakeholder discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/50).

## Timelines

The only guaranteed date throughout the release cycle is the 22nd. On this date,
the `self-managed release` will be published together with the release announcement.

**All other dates** are **a guideline only** and cannot be considered a deadline
when it comes to what will be included into any type of release. This includes the
[development month] and the dates defined there as well as any promises given to
customers. This is strictly because there are a lot of moving parts to be considered
when preparing a release which includes working on highest priority and severity
issues as well as security related issues.

Keep in mind that, if it is absolutely necessary to get a certain feature
ready for a specific version, merge the feature early in the development cycle.
Merges closer to the release date are absolutely not guaranteed to be included
in that specific monthly `self-managed release`.
For GitLab.com releases, timelines are different and described below.

### GitLab.com releases

In June 2019, GitLab.com transitioned to more frequent deploys through `auto-deploys`
as a first step towards continuous deployments. The [auto deploy transition] document
was created to serve as a transition overview document as we progress further
towards even more frequent deployments. As we transitioned, the timelines
for GitLab.com releases have changed and the current general process is
described below.

New auto-deploy branches are created every 8 hours at 04:00, 12:00, 20:00 UTC. 

Once a new branch is created, only commits that pass the CI tests are eligible for deployments ("green build"). This means that if specs are failing in
[gitlab-org/gitlab], the deployments cannot progress further.

Automated tasks in the [release-tools] project are setup to drive the next steps:

- Twice every hour, a task runs to cherry-pick merge requests labeled with `~"Pick into auto-deploy"` (See [Labels of importance]).
- Twice every hour, a task searches for the latest "green build" in the auto-deploy branch.
  - If it finds a commit that has not been previously deployed, it will start the process of creating a new package.
  - If the commit has already been deployed, the task will not take any actions.

When a new package is built, it is automatically deployed to `staging.gitlab.com`.
As part of the deployment to this environment, a set of automated QA integration tests are run.

When the automated QA tests pass, the deployment automatically progresses to the
[canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#canary-testing) stage where it is exposed to a sub-set of Production traffic.

After some time in the [canary] stage, and provided no new exceptions or alerts are
reported, the release is considered to be ready for deployment to GitLab.com.

The promotion to the full Production GitLab.com fleet is triggered manually by the release
managers and this can happen at any point in time but will usually not happen if there are [Deployment blockers].

Each deployment will trigger a notification in the Slack channel [#announcements](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C8PKBH3M5).
After each successful deployment, a QA issue is created in [release/tasks] issue tracker.
The purpose of these notifications are to inform the people who are involved in the
process that their change is going through environments. This allows them to
execute any manual testing or other tasks related to the release of their fix/feature.

### Deployment blockers

Anyone can **block or halt a deployment** by:
* Declaring an [severity::2 incident](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#reporting-an-incident)
* Alerting the Release Managers in the [#releases] channel. 

In addition, automated deployments to **any production environment** (including [canary]), are
halted during the change lock period. Currently, the change lock period is:

* Between every Friday 23:00 UTC and Monday 07:00 UTC.
* Fourth Thursday of November (US thanksgiving, limited availability company wide).
* 24th and 25th of December (Christmas according to Gregorian calendar, limited availability company wide).
* 1st of January (New Years day, limited availability company wide).

During the change lock period, manual deployment can be triggered through GitLab ChatOps if the deployment fixes **a severity::1 availability or security issue**.

Deployments to production will be blocked by the following events:

1. An [active severity::1, severity::2 or severity::3 incident](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#labeling).
1. Ongoing [change issues with C1 and C2 criticality](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#change-criticalities).
1. New exceptions in [Sentry reported in the canary environment](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/).

Release Managers may decide, with input from the [EOC](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#roles-and-responsibilities) to override a block and continue with the deployment. 

### Self-managed releases

The `self-managed release` timelines are concentrated around the 22nd. One week
before the release date, the release managers will start preparing for the release
by ensuring that the GitLab.com releases are in a consistent state. This means
that what gets into the `self-managed release` fully depends on **the state of
GitLab.com releases**.

The `self-managed release` will only contain code that is successfully running
on GitLab.com at the time the release manager decides to finalise the release.

This can be as early as 5 work days or as late as 1 day before the 22nd.
This fluctuation comes from a possibility of 22nd being at or right after the weekend
or instability on GitLab.com in the run-up to the 22nd.
The release manager preparing the final release will post an announcement in [#releases], [#development](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L) and [#g_delivery](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCFV016SV)
with a link to the final branch.

As mentioned earlier, if it is absolutely necessary to include a certain feature/fix
in that months `self-managed` release, merge it early in the development cycle or
no later than a couple of weeks before.
The same applies for items that need to go to the next
release; if it is absolutely necessary to include it in the next months release, merge
it after the `self-managed release` has been prepared.

Just because a merge request has a milestone of the current release `XX.YY` set,
does not mean that it will end up in the same release. Milestone describes
the target release, but only guarantee that it will be included in the same
release is if it is running on GitLab.com around the time release preparation starts.

## Labels of importance

For both types of releases, there are a few labels of specific importance.

### GitLab.com releases

For code that needs to be deployed to GitLab.com with higher priority than the
regular cadence, we have `~"Pick into auto-deploy"` label.

The automated systems that create a new GitLab.com release will look for this label
specifically, and any merge request with this label and an severity::1/severity::2 severity label will be automatically cherry-picked
into the active auto-deploy branch. In case the merge request cannot be picked,
which can happen if there is a conflict in the files being picked, the message
will be posted in the merge request asking the author to create a new merge request
targeting the currently active release branch.

The label should be only used under the following circumstances, when the merge
request:

- Fixes a severity::1/severity::2 bug
- Resolves a regression that can lead to a severity::1/severity::2 problem
- Urgent performance or availability fix that can improve the stability of
GitLab.com

If this label is added because a merge request is blocking further deploys,
consider leaving a note in [#releases] Slack channel to raise awareness of the status.

**For new features or non-urgent fixes**, the label **should not be used** because
the new release is only days or hours away.

Directions on how to how to know whether a MR is deployed to GitLab.com are in the [release/docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general%2Fdeploy%2Fauto-deploy.md#auto-deploy-status).

### Self-managed releases

Similar to the above mentioned label, each `self managed release` has a label
to highlight that a certain merge request should be backported to the targeted
release. For example, releases in the 12.3 series will have `~"Pick into 12.3"`
label which will signal that this merge request should be included in one of the
[next patch releases being created][creating patch release]. The patch releases are created as needed but only according to our [maintenance policy].

The label should be applied in the following situations:

- The backport (stable) branch has been created, the release on the 22nd is not created
and the merge request fixes a critical regression.
- The 22nd has passed and the merge request fixes a bug.

The label should not be applied to merge requests:

- Introducing new features
- Resolving a security vulnerability because process for security releases differs
from the regular release

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who are the release managers for release X?

You can find this out by taking a look at the [GitLab Release
Managers](https://about.gitlab.com/community/release-managers/) schedule.

### What is a release candidate and when are they created?

A release candidate (RC) is a GitLab package that includes the changes that will
make it into the final self-managed release, except for the rare case where a
change may need to be reverted. RCs are only created for the monthly
self-managed release, not patch releases. The amount of RCs created per month
will vary per release.

There is no fixed point in time where a release manager creates a release
candidate. Instead, this is based entirely on how the release process has been
going, what the state is of GitLab.com, etc.

Release candidates are created whenever possible, and as such there are no
guarantees on creation timing. This will depend on factors such as:

* Any incidents on GitLab.com that are or have been going on in the run-up to
  the release.
* Any (critical) security releases that require the attention of release
  managers.
* Any issues with our auto-deployment pipelines.
* Other release related work that may delay or prevent the creation of a release
  candidate until said work is dealt with.

In other words, if you want to know when a release candidate is created your
best option is to join one of the following Slack channels:

* [#releases]
* [#f_upcoming_release]

### Will release managers create a release candidate earlier if I ask them to?

It is up to a release manager to decide when to create a release candidate,
taking into account the state of deployments and GitLab.com.

Please do not message a release manager in private about release related
questions or requests. Instead, post your request/question in the [#releases]
channel.

### How can I determine if my merge request will make it into the monthly release?

When we create release candidates, the [Release Tools project][release-tools]
will post a comment on the merge requests included in the release candidate
(unless they were included in a prior release candidate). When you see this
comment you will know the merge request will be included in the release, unless
it is reverted in a later release candidate.

For more information, refer to the [Auto-deploy
status](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/deploy/auto-deploy.md#auto-deploy-status)
command.

In the runup to the 22nd, release managers will also start announcing
what commit will at the very least make it into the release. Such notifications
are shared in Slack [#releases] channel and will look something like this (format is defined in the [release-tools monthly template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-tools/-/blob/master/templates/monthly.md.erb)):

> This is the candidate commit to be released on the 22nd.
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/commits/4033cb0ed66de77a4b5c1936e33de918edef558e

The last commit to make it into the release will have a message similar to this:

> :mega: Barring any show-stopping issues, this is the final commit to be released on the 22nd.
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commits/13-1-stable-ee

### When do I need to have my MR merged in order for it to be included into the monthly release?

The earlier in the monthly cycle your MR is merged, the higher the chances are for it to be included in that months release.

There is no guaranteed "cut-off", "freeze" or any other date defined under which the MR will be included.

Availability, security and performance of GitLab.com is a pre-requisite for any monthly self-managed release.
If GitLab.com is not experiencing any issues, MR's merged as late as the 20th of the month were included in the release.
On the opposite side, when GitLab.com stability was lower, MR's merged as early as 15th of the month were not included.

In other words:

**The quality and stability of what is delivered by everyone defines the final MR that will be included in the monthly release.**

For more detailed answer, see [self-managed release timelines](/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1).


### When will my merge request be deployed?

We currently create an auto-deployment branch at a [specific
timeline](/handbook/engineering/releases/index.html#gitlabcom-releases-1).

For a merge request with [a specific
label](/handbook/engineering/releases/index.html#gitlabcom-releases-2), the
process is different.

### How can I determine what environment my merge request is currently in?

See [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/deploy/auto-deploy.md#status-of-a-merged-mr-or-a-commit)
guide for more information.

### I found a regression in the QA issue, what do I do next?

If you've found a regression with a potentially a high [severity], immediately follow the steps in [Deployment blockers] to halt the deployment.

If a regression is found in a new feature, and only that feature is affected, follow the directions in the QA issue created in the [release/tasks] project for a regular regression.

### What's the process for a release of type X?

The different processes are documented here:

- Self-managed releases:
  - [Monthly releases][process-monthly-release]
  - [Critical security releases][process-security-release-critical]
  - [Non-critical security releases][process-security-release-non-critical]
  - [Patch releases][process-patch-release]
- GitLab.com releases:
  - [Auto-deploy releases][process-auto-deploy-release]
  - [Hot patch]

### A security issue was assigned to me, where should I start?

See the [Security Release process as Developer] documentation for more information.

Also, make sure to see [Security Releases How to video] for a broad explanation about all the steps required as a Developer when working on a security fix.

### Why wasn't my security fix included in the Security Release?

Security issues created on [GitLab Security] need to be associated with the Security Release Tracking issue for them to be included on the Security
Release. Make sure to use the [security issue template] and follow the steps there.

### How many backports do I need when working on a security issue?

Besides the merge request targeting `master`, three backports will be needed targeting the last two monthly releases and the current release. 
For more information, see [security release backports].

### How can I Hot patch an issue?

See the [Hot patch] documentation for details on how to Hot patch. Note that hot patches may help with the resolution of severe incidents on GitLab.com but can only exist for a temporary period of time and block further deployments until fully fixed. See the [Hot patch] documentation for details about what can be patched.
