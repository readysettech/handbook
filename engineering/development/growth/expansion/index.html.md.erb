## Vision

The Expansion Group is part of the [Growth section]
and works directly with our product counterparts on the [Product Direction for Expansion](/direction/expansion/).
As well as delivering features for GitLab products the Expansion Group works to deliver product based [Growth-Deliverables](/handbook/product/growth/#growth-deliverables).

See [What's keeping us busy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/expansion/#whats-keeping-us-busy)

The Expansion Group also contribute to GitLab navigation (`Category:Navigation`, [Direction](/direction/expansion/navigation/) and [UX](/handbook/engineering/ux/navigation/)).

* I have a question. Who do I ask?

Questions should start by @ mentioning the Product Manager for the [Expansion group](/handbook/product/product-categories/#expansion-group)
or creating a new issue in the Growth Product [Expansion issues] list.

## How we work

* We're data savvy
* In accordance with our [GitLab values]
* Transparently: nearly everything is public
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on
* Everyone can contribute; no silos

### Prioritization

Prioritization is a collaboration between Product, UX, Data, and Engineering.

* We use the [ICE framework](/direction/growth/#growth-ideation-and-prioritization) for experiments.
* We use [Priority](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#priority-labels)
and [Severity](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#severity-labels) labels for bugs.

### Workflow

We use the [Product Development workflow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) when working on issues and
merge requests across multiple projects.

While not all of the work we do relates to the GitLab project directly, we use
[milestones](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/) to track `Deliverables` and other enhancements.

#### Overview

| Board | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Planning] |  This board shows Expansion team work that has been allocated to a particular milestone. |
| [Deliverables] | A subset of the milestone board shows issues the Product Manager has determined to be `Deliverables`. |

#### Working boards


* The validation track is where the Product Manager - usually in collaboration with `UX` - defines what the team should aim to deliver. Once complete, the Product Manager will move to `workflow::planning breakdown` (larger issues) or straight to `workflow::scheduling` for Engineering to pick up. If there is no Engineering input required the issue can be closed.
* The Retention Engineering group (`group::retention`) schedules issues for development in the build phase, based on the Product Managers priorities. For `bugs` and `security issues`, [Priority](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#priority-labels) and Severity labels will have been added by the Product Manager.
* Combined workflow board shows the combined workflow including validation and build tracks.

| Validation (PM/UX) | [All](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1506660?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aexpansion) | [All](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-services/-/boards/1509980) |
| Build (Eng) | [All](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1506701?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aexpansion) | [All](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-services/-/boards/1509985) |
| Combined | [All](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1158847?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Agrowth&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aexpansion) | [All](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-services/-/boards/1521362) |

The above boards can be filtered by milestone to provide additional context around priority.
For example a `priority::3` security issue ([due within 90 days](/handbook/engineering/security/#severity-and-priority-labels-on-security-issues))
will be added to one of the next 3 milestones by the Engineering team during the `workflow::scheduling` stage to ensure that SLA is met.

### UX
The Growth UX team has a [handbook page](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/growth/) which includes [Growth specific workflows](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/growth/#how-we-work).

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Expansion Group:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Backend Engineering Manager, Growth:Acquisition, Expansion and Retention', role_regexp: /(Growth:Expansion)/) %>

## Stable Counterparts

We work closely with our colleagues in the [Retention](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/retention/), [Fulfillment](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/fulfillment/)
and [Telemetry](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/acquisition-conversion-be-telemetry/) groups.

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%=
other_manager_roles = ['Director of Engineering, Growth']
direct_managers_role = 'Backend Engineering Manager, Growth:Acquisition, Expansion and Retention'
roles_regexp = /[,&] (Growth)/

stable_counterparts(role_regexp: roles_regexp, direct_manager_role: direct_managers_role, other_manager_roles: other_manager_roles)
%>
