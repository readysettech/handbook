## Vision

Enable engineers across the world by having top notch planning and issue tools for managing their work, awesome tools to organize their code and evolve their codebase through the best code review and online editing experience.
Support organizations to have an easy entrance level to use GitLab by having great import capabilities, a great documentation experience and administration tools.
By having Gitter we give open source communities a central place to communicate.

We thrive for ownership of the things that we built by having a clear view on its performance and stability in production. We constantly challenge ourselves to build a better, faster and more robust application.
