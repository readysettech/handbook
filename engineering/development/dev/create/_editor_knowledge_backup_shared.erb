# Backup ☎️

In the scenario where an Engineering Manager (EM) is unexpectedly out of the office we will immediately implement this backup plan to support a smooth and stable day-to-day work experience for all team members and stable counterparts.
In case that the regular EM is not available, the stable counter part will jump in and support the team wherever possible. 

- Matt will be available for FE
- Roman will be available for BE

## What can Engineers do to help

Consider pinging the standing EM on important things and help proactivley to follow the usual processes around Weekly Catch Up Meetings, Sprint Planning, Retrospectives or other meetings.

## What happens to 1-1s

1-1s will be run in an asynchronous manner, where a new Google Doc will be shared with focus on status and enablement.
