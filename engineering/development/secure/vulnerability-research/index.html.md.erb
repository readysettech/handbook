## Top-level Responsibilities

* Maintain the [advisory database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db)
* Perform research and develop proofs of concepts that impact the Secure stage

## Mission

To perform research and develop proofs of concepts that increase the
capabilities and effectiveness of the
[Secure stage](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/secure/).
Additionally, the team's mission is to share security expertise and practical
experience.

## Vision

* Drive innovative tools and techniques for identifying security
  vulnerabilities
* Be a fixture of innovation within the security community

### Short-term

* Automate the advisory database maintenance

### Mid-term

* Improve the current Secure stage feature set

### Long-term

* Develop innovative new features that may be integrated into the Secure stage

## Dogfooding

Ideally, research and proofs of concepts produced by the team will be able to
be quickly dogfooded, with GitLab itself being the first customer. Successful
iterations of developed tools can then be transitioned into the product to be
made available to the wider GitLab community in an automated fashion.
