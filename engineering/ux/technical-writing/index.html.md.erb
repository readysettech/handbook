## About Us

The primary goal of the Technical Writing team is to continuously develop the GitLab
product documentation to meet the evolving needs of all users and administrators.

Documentation educates readers about features and best practices,
and enables them to efficiently configure, use, and troubleshoot GitLab. To this end, the
team also manages the [docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com) site and related process and tooling.

Our team comprises:

- A [Senior Technical Writing Manager](/job-families/engineering/technical-writing-manager/#senior-manager-technical-writing).
- A [Technical Writing Manager](/job-families/engineering/technical-writing-manager/).
- A group of [Technical Writers](/job-families/engineering/technical-writer/).

Technical Writers partner with anyone in the GitLab community who is concerned with
documentation, especially developers, who are typically the first to update docs for the
GitLab features that they code.

Use the private-to-GitLab [#docs](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C16HYA2P5)
Slack channel to contact the Technical Writing team. To contact the entire team
in a GitLab issue or MR, use `@gl-docsteam`.

## Projects

Technical Writers:

- Act as maintainers of documentation for many [engineering projects](../../projects/).
- Act as authors or reviewers of the documentation in collaboration with others in the GitLab community.
- Are [assigned](#assignments) to specific DevOps stage groups.

For more information on documentation at GitLab, see:

- The [Documentation](../../documentation/) section of the Handbook.
- [GitLab Documentation guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/) in the contributor documentation.

## Slack channels

The Technical Writing team manages team-specific and general documentation-related Slack channels:

- `#docs`: For generic GitLab documentation discussion.
- `#docs-comments`: For automated messages from [Disqus comments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/structure.html#disqus).
- `#docs-processes`: For discussion relating to the [Style Guide group](#style-guide-group) and documentation processes.
- `#docs-tooling`: For discussion relating to the [Test Automation Commitee](#test-automation-committee),
  documentation tooling, and the `gitlab-docs` project.
- `#docs-site-changes`: For automated messages from [`gitlab-docs`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs) project.
- `#tw-team`: For Technical Writing team chat.
- `#tw-social`: For Technical Writing team social chat!

## Responsibilities

The team is broadly responsible for the following areas at GitLab.

### Content

- [Documentation content](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Documentation&label_name[]=epic-level-1&search=Content), including:
  - [Developing new content](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/774) to meet the needs of the community.
  - [Reviewing and collaborating on documentation plans](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/776), reviewing doc merge requests or recently merged docs, and ensuring that content meets style and language standards.
  - [Reorganizing, revamping, and authoring improved content](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/775) to ensure completeness and a smooth user experience.
- UI content
  - Collaborating with Product Designers on and review of various forms of UI text, such as microcopy, links from the UI to documentation, error messages, UI element labels, etc.

### Publishing

[Documentation Site](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Documentation) (docs.gitlab.com) including
maintaining and enhancing the documentation site’s:

- Architecture
- Design
- Automation
- Versioning
- Search
- SEO
- Feedback methods
- Analytics

### Processes

[Documentation Process](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/779), including:

- Ensuring that processes are in place and being followed to keep the GitLab docs up to date.
- Following and optimizing documentation workflows with Product and Engineering, Documentation Team workflows, and the division of work.
- Triaging doc-related issues.
- Refining the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html) and continuously improving content about GitLab documentation and its contribution process.
- Making it easier for anyone to contribute to the documentation while efficiently handling community contributions to docs.

#### Style Guide group

The Style Guide group is responsible for style recommendations for the product
documentation and release posts, and for the upkeep of the
[Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html).

Although participation in the group will rotate through the Technical Writer
team (on a schedule yet to be determined), any Technical Writer (or other
contributor) can make suggestions for documentation style updates or additions
by creating an issue/MR with the `~tw-style` label and then assigning the
issue/MR to the Style Guide group team members.

Team members will complete their work for most of the raised style issues
asynchronously, but will raise major changes or issues requiring additional
direction to the DRI for resolution.

Use the following searches to track completed style-related issues:

- [GitLab project style issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=tw-style)
- [GitLab project style MRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=tw-style)
- [Technical Writing project style issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=tw-style)

#### Test Automation Committee

The Test Automation Committee covers:

- Content linting in documentation or other places where technical content may be displayed, such as the GitLab UI or Release Post.
  - The development and maintenance of linting with Vale, Markdownlint, and potential UI app/views content linting.
- Other related testing:
  - Nanoc tests, including the external links checker.
  - `lint-doc.sh`, which includes checking file permissions and preventing new `README.md` files.
  - Any future doc site rendering tests (e.g. with Selenium) or YML file checking (e.g. with YAMLlint).

Responsibilities:

- Implement new linting requests, driven by style changes or with accompanying style change proposals, where applicable.
- Review MRs with the `~tw-testing` label.
- Maintain and update current linting rules as needed.
- Maintain and update linting applications, including version updates and pipeline configuration.
- Monitor #docs-linting.
- Monitor the `#docs-tooling` [Slack channel](#slack-channels) and help with testing questions.

Committee roles:

- The docs test automation DRI:
  - Is a required approver for any new rule.
  - Is responsible for seeking manager approval for significant linting changes, such as *new* linting tools, scripts, pipeline jobs, and so on.
  - Is a recommended reviewer for new or changed regex in rules.
  - Maintains a board for `~tw-testing`, triages issues, and helps ensure issues/MRs move to resolution.
  - Raises process/policy improvements for review by the TW leadership team.
- The Vale DRI:
  - Is a required approver for any new Vale rule (new Vale YAML files).
- One additional member.
- Any member must review or approve a change/addition to a rule.
- No pre-set term limits. Members of the TW team can discuss potential changes and TW management can implement changes.
- All committee members:
  - Can author, review, and approve changes to existing rules.
  - Can merge changes to existing rules that have proper approvals.

For current membership, see [Assignments to other projects and subjects](#assignments-to-other-projects-and-subjects).

### Collaboration

[Collaboration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/779), including:

- Working on documentation efforts with Product, Support, Marketing, Engineering, Community Marketing, other GitLab teams, and the wider GitLab community.
- Ensuring that relevant documentation is easily accessible from within the product.
- Acting as reviewers of the monthly [release post](../../handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/).

This work is sorted into the [top-level Documentation epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap?label_name%5B%5D=Documentation&label_name%5B%5D=epic-level-1&scope=all&sort=created_asc&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
linked above.

### Assignments

Technical Writers (TWs) are assigned to and collaborate
with other teams and groups as described on the [DevOps stages](#designated-technical-writers),
[Development Guidelines](#assignments-to-development-guidelines), and
[other subjects](#assignments-to-other-projects-and-subjects) sections below.

#### Assignments to DevOps Stages and Groups
{: #designated-technical-writers}

The designated Technical Writer is the go-to person for their assigned
[stage groups](/handbook/product/categories/). They collaborate with other team members to plan new
documentation, edit existing documentation, review any proposed changes
to documentation, suggest changes to the microcopy exposed to users,
and generally partner with subject matter experts (SMEs) in all situations where
documentation is required.

The backup writer is assigned to cover merge request reviews and
urgent matters for the designated tech writer when they are out
(vacations, sickness, and any other temporary leave). They can
also naturally pair to work together on complex issues when needed.

Not sure what group a feature falls into? Search the [product categories](/handbook/product/categories/).
{: .alert .alert-info}

<%= partial("includes/stages/tech-writing") %>

<!--
  To update the table above:

  - For tech writer's name per stage, change data/stages.yml and includes/stages/tech-writing.html.haml
  - To turn off a stage, set tw: false in data/stages.yml

Reference: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/24952
-->

Technical Writers are encouraged to review and improve documentation of other
stages but they aren't required to. When contributing to docs they don't own,
they must respect the assigned TW's ownership and ensure to request their review
and approval when adding significant changes to their docs.

#### Assignments to Development and API Guidelines

For content changes specifically related to a particular stage group, the TW assigned to that
group can perform the review and then assign the MR to the TW assigned Dev Guidelines for
approval/merge.

##### Development Guidelines

The Technical Writer (TW) assigned to Development Guidelines (SME) is [Marcia Ramos]
and her backup TW is [Mike Jang].
As GitLab grows, it's important to keep high-quality documentation and ensure that the
guidelines for contributors are consistent and aligned throughout the organization.
Development Guidelines consist of:

- GitLab's [Development Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/):
  the entire content of [`gitlab/doc/development/*`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/doc%2Fdevelopment) must be reviewed and approved by the TW assigned to Dev Guidelines, with the exception of the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html) which is maintained by the [Techncial Writing Style Guide group](#style-guide-group).
- [GitLab Design System ("Pajamas")](https://design.gitlab.com/): the entire content of
  [`contents`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/tree/master/contents)
  must be reviewed and approved by the TW assigned to Dev Guidelines.
- [GitLab UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/): docs within this project do not require
  TW review. The TW for Dev Guidelines will help in creating and maintaining minimum requirements
  for these docs through specific guidelines and templates, and assist the team upon request.

For Development Guidelines that may be established in other projects, the assigned TW will
help upon request. If a larger project is created with ongoing development, the TW for Dev Guidelines
and TW Manager will evaluate with the engineers the necessity of regular reviews.

 -->
##### API Guidelines

The Technical Writers (TW) assigned to API Development Guidelines are [Axil] and [Mike Jang].
These guidelines include patterns and templates required to set up GraphQL and REST (OpenAPI) documentation.

For content changes specifically related to a particular stage group, the TW assigned to that
group is responsible for that content.

#### Backup Technical Writers

Each Technical Writer has an assigned *backup Technical Writer* that’s listed in
the [DevOps Stages and Groups assignment table](#assignments).

Although the usual role of a backup Technical Writer is to provide coverage for
primary writers who may be out of the office, the backup can also be a resource for
a stage/group's normal Technical Writer. For example, depending on their
bandwidth, the backup may be able to help with coverage if the primary Technical
Writer gets too busy (for example, if the primary writer also has
[release post duty](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/managers/)).

Technical Writers should ensure that their out-of-office messaging reflects
their backup, and should communicate with their PMs and developers to introduce
their backup Technical Writer.

Whenever you’re communicating with a backup Technical Writer to ask for an
issue's status or their assistance with a technical writing issue, please be
aware that they may require additional context, and that your request will need
to be incorporated into the list of stage/group and feature priorities for
*their* primary responsibility.

If neither the primary or backup Technical Writer are available to help, you can
post in the [#docs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C16HYA2P5) channel to
ask for general assistance for your issue.

#### Regularly scheduled tasks

Along with Technical Writers' normally assigned work, there are recurring tasks
that need to be regularly completed:

- *Release Post TW Lead:* A Technical Writer
  [reviews the content](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#tw-lead)
  for the release post published at the end of each milestone. See the
  [Release Post Scheduling](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/managers/)
  Handbook page for the most updated list of each milestone's assigned writer.
- *Docs project logs checks:* The docs project has jobs in the
  [CI/CD pipeline logs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/pipelines)
  that report fixable issues. These jobs are allowed to silently fail to
  avoid having minor failures prevent the site's deployment. The Technical
  Writer with this task should check the following logs regularly, and if
  needed, create MRs to fix reported failures or create issues for significant
  reported problems:

  - External Link Checker log: Over time, links in [GitLab's documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com)
    to external sites can change without warning. To identify these now-outdated
    links, run the `test_external_links` manual job in the most recently run
    [Scheduled pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/pipelines).
  - Kramdown build logs: Some Markdown formatting issues that can cause
    rendering problems aren't detected by regular linting, but are flagged by
    Kramdown when building the site. On the
    [docs project pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/pipelines)
    page, click the pipeline you want to examine, and in its **Jobs** tab, click
    the job link for `compile_prod` or `compile_dev`. In the provided job log,
    search for `kramdown warning` messages, which are usually caused by
    problematic HTML or square brackets.
  - Trailing white space test: To reduce the burden of contributing
    documentation to GitLab, we don't block the addition of trailing whitespace
    in Markdown files. To avoid building up a large amount of technical debt,
    run the **test_EOL_whitespace** manual job in the most recently run
    [scheduled pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/pipelines).

Current schedule of regular Technical Writing team tasks:

**Note:** Be sure to keep the Release Post column in sync with the
[Release Post Scheduling](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/managers/)
page.

### Onboarding Technical Writers

While the Technical Writer is onboarding, they will be assigned to
shadow groups and then start contributing as trainees, as described
below. Veteran Technical Writers will coach them through the process.

To consult the current assignments, see the [onboarding Technical Writers spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17KULdrZZpUPFMp-vYhw3fErlit9oD99Yh6L60aMsiyc/edit#gid=0).

**Group shadowing**

For the first release cycle that begins after the new member start
date, they will shadow (read) their buddy's work in their most active
Stage Group, plus one other stage group/writer decided with the
tech writing manager and the team. Veteran Technical Writers will
proactively share relevant issues, merge requests, and communications
with their shadows by using a `#tw-onboarding-<groupname>`
Slack channel, creating it if it doesn't already exist, and answering questions.

**Group trainees**

For the second release cycle that begins after the new member's start
date, unless the tech writing manager extends the shadowing phase,
they will act as a trainee on one or more groups as assigned by the manager.
The intent is to take on the group as its Technical Writer as of the
next release. The veteran Technical Writer who is assigned to that Group
will assign substantial parts of the work to the new member for this group,
which accounts to roughly half of the groups's reviews of MRs with docs, UI text,
and release post content; a small but substantial documentation
authoring project; a few minor doc improvement projects/fixes.

**Group coaching**

For the third release cycle, the onboarding tech writer assumes the
full role of Technical Writer for their assigned group, except that
they will not yet have [merge rights](#merge-rights). The former TW assigned to the group is now the coach,
who will review all their work (including reviews they perform of other authors)
before merging it or approving it for another maintainer to merge.
They may share the burden of these reviews with other Technical Writers.

### Reviews

Technical Writers are assigned merge requests to review that contain documentation changes
authored by GitLab team members and community contributors.
The reviews are assigned by subject matter according to the [Technical Writer assignments](#assignments)
to [stage groups](../../product/product-categories/#devops-stages) or other specialties.

#### Review principles

The following principles guide Technical Writers when conducting technical writing reviews:

- A technical writing review aims to confirm that the content:
  - Is clear, grammatically correct, discoverable, navigable, and written with the perspective of the user (or other intended audience) in mind.
  - Follows the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html).
    and Pajamas Design System content guidance on:
    - [Voice and tone](https://design.gitlab.com/content/voice-tone).
    - [Terminology](https://design.gitlab.com/content/terminology).
    - [Punctuation](https://design.gitlab.com/content/punctuation).
  - Avoids redundancy, bad file locations, typos, and broken links.
- While Technical Writers apply any subject-matter expertise they possess, a technical writing
  review focuses on tone, style, and narrative flow.
- A technical writing review confirms that an authoritative source has checked for technical accuracy.
  The Technical Writer may serve as that authoritative source if they have the required knowledge or
  can efficiently perform any necessary verification.
- Because every writer can benefit from an editorial review, all significant changes to content
  submitted by Technical Writers should go to another Technical Writer for review before merge.
  Because [velocity](/handbook/engineering/#the-importance-of-velocity) is important, Technical
  Writers can request a post-merge review from another Technical Writer in exceptional circumstances.

### Merge rights

The Technical Writing team is given merge rights (through
[Maintainer access](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#how-to-become-a-project-maintainer))
to GitLab projects as part of their role. Not all developers get Maintainer access. Technical
writers should use this privilege responsibly.

As Maintainers, Technical Writers should limit what they merge to:

- Documentation, typically in Markdown-formatted files.
- UI text, error messages, and link-related fixes, with the approvals of appropriate engineer(s).
- Documentation-related tooling and configuration such as linters, and changes
  to the [`gitlab-docs`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs) project. Engineers in the
  [Static Site Editor team](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create-static-site-editor/) are
  available for code review and merges.

In addition, Technical Writers should:

- Never merge an MR with a failed pipeline, unless the failures are unrelated to the changes. If in
  doubt, ask an engineer.
- Ensure that MRs are complete before merging, with appropriate labels and milestones.
- Ensure that the DRI or nominated backup (for [the stage](#assignments) or
  [other documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues/123)) has reviewed
  and approved the MR.

## Documentation process

See:

- [Technical writing workflow](workflow/) in the handbook.
- [Documentation workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html) in the contributor documentation.
