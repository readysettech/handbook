## Overview of Demo Systems

The GitLab Demo Systems provide infrastructure for the GitLab Customer Success, Marketing, Sales, and Training teams to demonstrate GitLab features, value propositions, and workflows in a variety of asynchronous and live capacities.

Please consider this handbook documentation to be the single source of truth ("SSOT") for all resources that use the `gitlabdemo.com` or `gitlabdemo.cloud` domain names.

The [GitLab Demo Systems - Master Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XwlqCCYiHyc6WzeEZ5xqjEe0ISeibj6qbAkea8EO3R0/edit?usp=sharing) has all of the slides that we've created that relate to the demo systems. These are mostly used in management discussions and onboarding presentations.

### Why do we have demo systems?

* **Why shouldn’t we just use GitLab.com?** Although you can use GitLab.com for showing most of the value of GitLab use cases, there are some administrative features that require the deployment of GitLab Omnibus infrastructure in AWS, GCP, or local VM/container. Many of our enterprise customers opt for self-managed over GitLab.com so we are mindful of “showing the customer what they’ll see in production”.

* **Why shouldn’t each team member build their own demos?** It is inefficient for Solutions Architects team members to spend a lot of time building the infrastructure and configuring servers needed for delivering demos to customers, so the Demo Systems team provides an economies-of-scale platform for Customer Success team members to simplify the provisioning of infrastructure and access to demo environments.

* **What’s special about our infrastructure?** The demo systems infrastructure doesn’t do anything special that a customer or partner company couldn’t do themselves with the appropriate staffing and engineering investment. We will be open sourcing our infrastructure-as-code methods, scripts and tools for the wider community to use to streamline their deployment of Omnibus infrastructure.

### Team Overview

The Demo Systems are architected and maintained by [Jeff Martin](https://gitlab.com/jeffersonmartin) ([Senior Demo Systems Engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/demo-systems-engineer/)). We have other team members in the Customer Success team that volunteer part-time to help support our users and infrastructure. Please contact Jeff on Slack with any questions or requests.

#### Notable Volunteers

* [Cristiano Casella](https://gitlab.com/ccasella) - Kubernetes support and infrastructure maintenance
* [Joel Krooswyk](https://gitlab.com/jkrooswyk) - Kubernetes support, GKE administration, and sample projects
* [Richard (REB) Baum](https://gitlab.com/xyzzy) - Omnibus support and legacy i2p infrastructure
