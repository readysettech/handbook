### Project plan

Each services engagement will include a Project Plan compiled based on the Statement of Work (SOW) and other discussions the PS team has with the customer.  This can include a Gantt chart, spreadsheet, or another form of plan.

Each service engagement will have a Google Sheet that shows the contracted revenue and the estimated cost measured in hours or days of effort required to complete the engagement. The cost estimate must be completed prior to SoW signature and attached to the opportunity in SFDC.
