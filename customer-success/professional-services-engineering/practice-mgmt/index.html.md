## Practice Management Overview

The professional services practice management team is responsible for maturing [current service offerings](https://about.gitlab.com/services/) and building new offerings including their go to market strategy. This page will help describe the areas of responsibility of the practice management team, how we operate and stay organized.

## Backlog, Workflows, and Kanban Board

The practice management team is using the top level label `Practice Management` to organize all of our work together. *Note: we are using labels at the [customer success group level](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success) because some projects have been put there for wider collaboration*  

Then, we use [these scoped labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/-/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&subscribed=&search=PS-Practice) to organize our work into service categories.

We are moving toward using standard global workflow labels to track issues from inception to completion, but currently use [custom workflow labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/-/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&subscribed=&search=ps%3A%3A) for a simple "TODO, Doing, Done" workflow. They are considering standarizing on workflow labels, but still TBD. They are using this base [kanban board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/-/boards/1736936?&label_name[]=Practice%20Management) to help visualize work flowing to completion. You can further filter based on service category scoped labels.

We are starting to use and refine our [roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/-/roadmap?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Practice%20Management) but it is still very much a work in progress. 

### Education Services practice management Labels

Here are the main labels specific to the Education Practice Management projects.

* `ProServ-practice::Education` (TO BE DEPRECATED in favor of [these scoped labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/-/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&subscribed=&search=PS-Practice) at the customer success group level)
* `Workflow::validation backlog` - Team member identifies audience needs and potential education services offering
* `Workflow::problem validation` - Practice manager validates needs addressed by proposed Education Services
* `Workflow::design` - Practice manager defines solution component requirements and confirms with ID that the proposed solution is feasible 
* `Workflow::solution validation` - Practice manager validates proposed Education Services solution will meet business objectives
* `Workflow::planning breakdown` - Practice manager works with ID to plan project work with issues and epics

## How tos

### How to create a new service SKU

SKUs for new PS offerings are requested by the PS Practice Manager. To request a new SKU, the Practice Manager must determine and complete the following items and steps to gain approval.

#### Required items

* A specimen SOW that can be referenced by the Item
* Established cost-basis and assumptions
* Hours and hourly cost
* Delivery cost (hours x hourly cost)
* Included T&E assumption (if any)

#### Steps for creating a SKU

The Practice Manager follows these steps to request creation of a new SKU.

1. Create an [issue in the Finance issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/finance/issues/new?issuable_template=New_PS_SKU) referencing the above requirements
1. Review with the Finance Business Partner for Sales
1. Make any require changes
1. Submit to VP of Customer Success for approval
1. Submit to CFO, CRO and CEO for approval
1. Once approved, submit to Accounting to create SKU in Zuora (note: Accounting does not create a SKU number but does add the offering to the product catalog)
1. Once it is added to the product catalog, make up a new SKU number for the offering and add it to the Current SKUs listing by editing the services.yaml file and creating a merge request.

#### Validating SKU shows in Salesforce
1. Login to salesforce.
1. Click on the opportunities tab.
1. Search for the `Test Account-NEW` opportunity.
1. Scroll down and click on the `New Quote` button.
1. In `Sold To Contact` and `Bill to Contact`, select PS Test account. 
1. Add `start date` as today. 
1. Scroll down and click `Next`.
1. Click the drop down the box next to `New Quote Flow` and select `Add Add On Products`.
1. In the `Professional Services and Training` Row, click the drop down that says `Select Plan` to see the current SKU offerings that the Sales Reps see.  


### How to edit a Professional Services product page

PS uses a file called services.yml as the single source of truth (SSoT) for offering descriptions and specifications. This file is used together with a documentation macro to populate various parts of the GitLab documentation and is also used by the [Services Calculator](https://services-calculator.gitlab.io/). The [Services SSOT Wiki Page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ps-process/-/wikis/Services-Single-Source-of-Truth) describes its various applications, attributes and maintenance processes. Team members who wish to update or add offerings can follow the instructions located on the wiki page.
