## Which companies can be listed here?

Any company that has been inspired by GitLab's culture and/or by any part of our handbook can be listed here.

[Transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency) is one of [GitLab's values](/handbook/values), and so we encourage you and your company to read our handbook and use the parts that make sense to your business, or even adapt it to your context.

With that, we want to know what on GitLab's culture or on GitLab's handbook inspired you, and how are you and your company using it to the benefit your business?

To be listed in this page, [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues) with the following information:

**Title:** Add company XYZ on Inspired by GitLab handbook page / Update company XYX on Inspired by GitLab handbook page

**Description:** Tells us what exactly was the inspiration, with a link to the handbook page so that others can have a look, and maybe get inspired as well. Optionally, send us your company's website URL so that we can link to it.

**Label:** handbook

Or, if you feel comfortable with making the change yourself, submit a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests), and we will be happy to review and have it merged as soon as possible. Don't forget to add the label 'handbook'.
