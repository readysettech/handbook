## Introduction

As a global, all-remote company, GitLab has a unique story to tell. 
A key part of telling that story is sharing what it's like to work here, because we wouldn't be successful without our people and our culture. 
This page outlines our approach to talent brand at GitLab.

### Our audience

The audience we hope to reach with our talent brand initiatives is both internal and external to GitLab:

- GitLab team members
- Job candidates and future team members
- The broader GitLab community 
- People interested in remote work 

## GitLab team member value proposition

We've defined our team member value proposition, and you can find it on the [GitLab Culture page](/company/culture/#life-at-gitlab). We're continuing to bring it to life across our digital channels to better tell the story of what it's like to be part of our global, all-remote team. 


## Digital channels for talent branding

### Jobs site

Our [GitLab jobs site](/jobs/) is where candidates can find information about working at GitLab, along with links to browse and apply for our vacancies. 

### Social media

We incorporate content about hiring and our culture on GitLab's [social media](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/social-marketing/) accounts so that there's one central place for candidates and the community to find out more about the company as a whole.

On LinkedIn, we have a specific [career page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gitlab-com/life) where candidates can find out more about life at GitLab. 

There are a number of videos on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/gitlab) that relate to working here:
- [Why work remotely?](https://youtu.be/GKMUs7WXm-E)
- [Everyone can contribute](https://youtu.be/V2Z1h_2gLNU)
- [Working remotely at GitLab](https://youtu.be/NoFLJLJ7abE)
- [This is GitLab](https://youtu.be/Mkw1-Uc7V1k)
- [What is GitLab?](https://youtu.be/MqL6BMOySIQ)


### Review sites

We want to be sure candidates who come across GitLab's profile on employer review sites have an accurate picture of what it's like to work here. 
There are some sites where GitLab has a company profile, but we do not own it or pay for additional features. On others, we have a managed presence. 

We encourage team members to leave reviews and share their stories on these sites to continue to keep an updated profile. We welcome both positive and negative feedback in these reviews.

#### Glassdoor

**Engaged employer**

As an engaged employer with Glassdoor, we're able to customize the branded content, videos, links, and images on our Glassdoor profile. Our contract with Glassdoor includes pages in these countries:
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Germany
- The Netherlands
- India
- Ireland
- Rest of World (all countries where Glassdoor does not have a separate presence)

This also includes sponsored international jobs (all countries outside of the US and UK), as well as the ability to respond to reviews.

**Responding to reviews**

The [Talent Brand Manager](/job-families/people-ops/talent-branding-manager/) responds to reviews on a weekly basis, with input from any necessary teams internally. More details are outlined in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slJ_C5hh_9_A078Mj8k5N5WyAXwYY45QMktCYwVBUZ8/edit?usp=sharing).

**Escalating reviews and tracking success**

Glassdoor reviews and ratings have valuable themes and trends that can help us improve our culture, hiring process, benefits, and more. 
We share ratings trends, key themes, or escalations to the appropriate contacts internally so that we can track our success and take addition action if needed. This includes:
- Recruiting team meeting - sharing hiring-related themes that have come up twice a month
- G&A metrics monthly review
- As-needed direct escalations - for reviews that require immediate action or response

**OpenCompany designation**

As an open, transparent company, the OpenCompany designation is important for us to have to best represent our talent brand. We take action to maintain this status throughout the year.
Achieving and maintaining OpenCompany requires that you:
- Keep company profile up to date
- Add 5-10 new photos every 12 months
- Get 5-60 new employee reviews (depending on company size) every 12 months
- Respond to 2-10 reviews (depending on company size) every 12 months
- Promote your profile with a link on your career site

**Profile updates** 

To be sure the details on our profile stay up to date, we [review these items](https://gitlab.com/gl-recruiting/talent-brand/-/issues/9) quarterly and make any needed updates:
- Headcounts and country numbers listed on our profile 
- Our status as the world's largest all-remote company
- New awards or recognition 
- Photos or videos recently published


#### Comparably

We have a [premium profile with Comparably](https://www.comparably.com/companies/gitlab), an employer review site that also offers recruitment marketing tools and [award programs](/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/#employer-awards-and-recognition). 

Our goal is to keep the feedback on our profile up to date by annually (Q3) sending a link to all team members where they can consider leaving feedback or a review.
