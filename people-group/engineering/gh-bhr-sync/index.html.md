## Overview

Considering our single source of truth for team member data is BambooHR, we need to make sure that applicants
are created in BambooHR once they are hired. We created a custom sync between Greenhouse and BambooHR to avoid
manual work adding the right data from one system to the other.

We check every 15 minutes if new applicants have been marked as hired on Greenhouse. If there are
any, we create a user on BambooHR with the applicant and offer data from Greenhouse. Before
this custom sync, we used a sync within Greenhouse itself but it didn't sync the data correctly.

### Synced fields

The sync is a one-way sync. We take the data from Greenhouse and add it to BambooHR. Some fields on BambooHR are calculated fields by using data
from Greenhouse. We do add a note on the candidate's activity saying we synced the profile.

Besides syncing the above fields, we also sync:

- Documents between Greenhouse and BamboorHR. The documents we sync are in the `attachments` on the
candidate itself. We only sync the signed offer letter and the resume. The signed offer letter is
synced to the `Contracts & Changes` and the resume is synced to the `Resumes and Applications`
folder on BambooHR. They are set to be shared with the new team member.
- Employment Status: these are different depending on which entity is linked to the team member.
It follows the process that is outlined in the [handbook](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/#adding-a-new-team-member-to-bamboohr). When there are changes in probations, a
change should also be made to [this file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/employment-automation/-/blob/master/data/probations.yml).

When required data is missing, the system is set up to send a Slack message about
this applicant. Currently these candidates will need to be synced manually.

### Progress

Currently the sync went through two iterations and has replaced most (but not all) manual work for the People Experience and Total Rewards teams.
Open issues can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=f-gh-bhr-sync).
If you want to add another field to the sync, feel free to [create a new issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/people-operations-engineering/-/issues/new).

### Missing Team Member

In case a hire wasn't synced, the People Experience team can execute the following
Slack command:

```
/pops run syncnewhire <id_in_greenhouse>
```

This will sync this person as it is described aboved. You can find the team member's ID in Greenhouse by looking at the URL for the member in Greenhouse. It is an 11-digit number listed between /people/ and the ? symbol. It is recommended that you
also create a [GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/employment-automation/issues/new?issuable_template=bug_with_greenhouse_bamboo_sync) so the team can investigate what went wrong.

### Resync Team Member

Sometimes a team member needs to be resynced (for example when the contract was changed _after_ it was signed). In that case the People Experience team can
execute the following Slack command:

```
/pops run resyncnewhire <id_in_greenhouse>
```

This command will trigger a pipeline and the candidate will be fully resynced to the existing profile
on BambooHR. You can find the team member's ID in Greenhouse by looking at the URL for the member in Greenhouse. It is an 11-digit number listed between /people/ and the ? symbol. When manual changes were made on the BambooHR profile there is a chance they are wiped out
by the resync.
