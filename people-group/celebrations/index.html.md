## Birthdays

The company encourages all GitLab team-members to take a day of vacation on their birthday by utilizing our [paid time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/) policy.
**BirthdayBot** our official birthday bot will announce team members birthday on #celebrations channel for the rest of the company to send you their wishes. A few things to note;
1. Any team member wishing to be excluded should refrain from including their birthday on their Slack profile.
1. If you would like to be included but are not comfortable with inputing the year in Slack, you can use `0000` as the year in your slack profile (ex. 0000-12-29), which will just show the month and day in your Slack profile. Alternatively, just reply with day and month to the bot on a private/direct message under apps section in Slack.
1. The bot will not announce how old you are turning just that it's your birthday, feel free to share that information on the thread if you wish to.
