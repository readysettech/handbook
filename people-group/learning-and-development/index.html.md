### Leadership Forum

An [overview](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/leadership-forum/#overview) about the format as well as topics and dates can be found on the [Leadership Forum](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/leadership-forum/) handbook page.

## Learning Initiatives 

### Certifications

We provide our team members with certifications to demonstrate their knowledge on specific topics. We have [outlined](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/certifications/) our current certifications as well as planned and upcoming certifications for the year.

### Career Development

Everyone's career development is different, but we have [outlined](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) what it can look like at GitLab. Career development also includes our [GitLab coaching framework](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/coaching/) to support managers with holding coaching discussions with their team. 

### Developing Emotional Intelligence

Whether you are a People Manager or an Individual Contributor, being skilled in "emotional intelligence" (also referred to as EQ) is a key attribute to interpersonal effectiveness. We have [outlined](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/emotional-intelligence/) the definition of emotional intelligence, how to understand your own EQ, how to develop your EQ in a [remote setting](/company/culture/all-remote/guide/), and building an inclusive environment with EQ. 

Another strategy to improve emotional intelligence is to apply the [Social Styles framework](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/emotional-intelligence/social-styles/) within your team to increase interpersonal interactions and team dynamics. 

### Language Courses

If you have any language courses you would like to recommend or links to websites please add them to this section.

 - [The 8 Best Interactive Websites for Adults to Learn English](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/english/best-websites-to-learn-english/)

There is also a way to practice foreign languages and ask for advice in several Slack channels, each dedicated to a specific language. You can find all these channels by searching for channels starting with #lang. If you're missing a channel for your target language, feel free to create one and mention it in #whats-happening-at-gitlab so that fellow GitLab team-members can join too!

### New Manager Enablement Program

GitLab has a growing [resource](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-development/) to enable all team members transitioning to a manager role. It contains a link to a checklist, readings, and a form to help learning and development customize your development as a manager.

We are piloting the [Manager Challenge](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-challenge/) program during the month of September to over 30 people leaders at GitLab. The Manager Challenge is to first step to building out a comprehensive manager enablement curriculum. 

## New Learning Content at GitLab

We are always working to create more learning content for our team members. If you have a learning request that you would like the Learning & Development team to develop in partnership with your team, please fill out a `learning-and-development-request` issue template in our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-and-development/-/issues). Our team will review and set the priority for your request based on the scale and impact across the organization. Learning items that will be applied and used across the company will take priority. 

If you have developed the learning content and would like the Learning & Development team to review, fill out a `learning-and-development-review` issue template in our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-and-development/-/issues). 

Our team will review and set the priority for your content request or review based on the scale and impact across the organization. Learning items that will be applied and used across the company will take priority. 

### How the L&D team prioritizes requests: 
*  Evaluate strategic impact of the learning session
*  Determine the level of work associated with the learning requirement
*  Assess the impacted audience groups of the session 
*  Identify measures of success 
*  Assess dates of delivery with course schedule and forecast future date

### Top five training content development principles

If you are devleoping content to meet your learning needs or partnering with the L&D team, here are five key principles to consider when formulating a learning session: 

1. **Know Your Audience** - Analyze and assess the course audience. Ensure that all audience needs are accounted for at every level in the organization you are delivering the training too. 

2. **Define Learning Objectives** - Highlight what you want the learner to walk away from the session with. Consider developing two to three broad overall statements of what the audience will acheive. 

3. **Break Down Complex Information** - Consider breaking down complex information into easy to digest visuals or text. Reference the handbook but do not be afraid to create a visual representation or use storytelling for the audience.

4. **Engage the Learner** - Adults learn through practice and involvement. Consider using tools to engage learners in a virtual setting like [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) or [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/business-u/) to stimulate interactivity. Ask the [L&D team](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/) for more insight on learning engagement tools. There are a lot you can leverage! 

5. **Implement Blended Learning Course Content** - Give the audience some pre-course work to read and review before the learning session. Use off-the-shelf resources and ensure the content is applicable to what will be covered in the session. Follow up with the audience following the session to gauge how they've applied what they've learned on the job through surveys and questionmaires. 

### Application of Adult Learning Theory

Adults learn differently in the workplace than they would in traditional learning environments or how they learned growing up. If you are developing training, consider applying principles related to Adult Learning Theories, those include: 

1. **Transformative learning:** The learning experience should aim to change the individual through transformative learning approaches. Start with learning experiences that appeal to your specific audience, and then move to activities that challenge assumptions and points of view.   

2. **Self-directed learning:** Most of the learning that adults do is outside the context of formal training, so there should be an emphasis on augmenting those informal learning experiences. Infuse applications of pre-reads and post-course follow up. Have the participants bring up examples of self-directed learning that they have taken that is related to the training course. 

3. **Experiential learning:** Adults learn through experiences and by doing. When designing a learning experience, apply activities to stimulate learning by doing through role-playing, simulations, virtual labs, case studies, etc. 

4. **Andragogy:** Recognize that adults learn differently than children. Design learning experiences with the assumption that your participants will come to the table with their own set of life experiences and motivations. Adults tend to direct their own learning, tend to learn better by doing, and will want to apply their learning to concrete situations as soon as possible. 


## Learning Management Systems

We are currently in the process of implementing a Learning Management System (LMS). We are also in the process of evaluating several content libraries to accompany the LMS to provide curated and off-the-shelf courses for our team members. The content will be supplemental to GitLab customized content. More details to come in the next few months! 

To help us continue to be [Handbook First](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first), course content in the LMS should be structured in the following ways: 

- Text in handbook
- Video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg)
- Test and certification in an open source platform or something without a price per user/student so we can invite all our million of users without incremental costs.
- Don't put text or video in the platform itself, only link to the handbook and video, so we  have a [single source of truth](/handbook/handbook-usage/#style-guide-and-information-architecture) and don't end up with duplicate content that is hard to keep up to date.

## Compliance Courses 

GitLab has a number of compliance courses and resources. Explore the drop downs below to learn more.

  <summary markdown='span'>
    Common Ground: Harassment Prevention Training
  </summary>

All team members are required to take a harassment prevention training. All new team members will have a task in their onboarding issue to complete this training using <a href="https://learning.willinteractive.com/">Will Interactive's Platform</a> within the first 30 days of hire. Once you get to that step in your onboarding issue, please do the following:

<ol>
<li>Log into BambooHR</li>
<li>On the Training tab, click on the Harassment Prevention training that aligns with your role (Supervisor or Team Member) and location (U.S. or Non-U.S.). The list of courses to choose from are: <b>FY21 Anti-Harassment Training for Non-U.S. Team Members</b>, <b>FY21 Anti-Harassment Training for Non-U.S. Supervisors</b>, <b>FY21 Anti-Harassment Training for U.S. Team Members</b>, or <b>FY21 Anti-Harassment Training for U.S. Supervisors</b>. You only need to complete one training. For managers and leaders, the course is 2 hours long, but you can stop and come back to it. For all other GitLab Team Members, this is 1 hour long.</li>
<li>Click on the <i>Sign Up Now</i> link</li>
<li>Enter in your name and GitLab email address</li>
<li>Create a password</li>
<li>You may be sent a link to verify your account</li>
<li>Once you have logged in successfully you will be taken to the course you selected in BambooHR. (You can use the navigation bar at the top right-hand side of screen for volume and screen settings. To the left and right of the center screen you should see this symbol: > which you can click on to move forward and back through the training.)</li>
<li>Once completed, please upload a copy of your certificate in BambooHR in the <i>Employee Uploads</i> folder</li>
<li>You may also keep a record of the certificate for your own files. To create the certificate, click on <i>view</i> in the course title</li>
<li>Scroll down to <i>users</i> then click on <i>completion certificates</i> to download the PDFs</li>
</ol>

If a Team Member moves from an individual contributer role to a manager role, they will be assigned a New Manager Enablement issue to work through. In this issue it will be verified if they have completed the correct level of harassment prevention training. If the team member has completed the "Team Member" level of the training, they will have to take the "Supervisor" level of the training as well.

Our <a href="/handbook/anti-harassment/?private=1">Anti-Harassment Policy</a> outlines guidelines, reporting and disciplinary action.
