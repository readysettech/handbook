## Introduction

Welcome to the Manager Challenge page. We are rolling out a pilot version of a 4 Week Manager Challenge in September 2020, "The GitLab Manager Challenge Program." All details relating to the challenge can be found here on this page. The first iteration of the program will be a pilot to a subset of team members at GitLab. Once the pilot has concluded, we will roll out the program to the broader GitLab team!

### Manager Challenge Learning Objectives

You may be asking yourself what you will achieve by taking part in the Manager Challenge program. Our goal is that participants walk away with the following skills after completing the four-week challenge: 
- Improve your performance by strengthening your management skills
- Develop a management style that incorporates a whole-person approach to leading others
- Handle difficult management situations with greater certainty in your decisions
- Use emotional intelligence to improve leadership and build more effective relationships
- Build an inclusive environment for your people that is built on trust
- Grow and strengthen skills in leading remote teams at GitLab

### Overview

**What** 

The Four Week Manager Challenge Program is a blended learning approach that incorporates self-paced daily challenges and live learning sessions to build foundational management skills. The program incorporates leadership assessments, interactive live learning sessions, and digital learning. 

**Why** 

The program is intended to build a set of baseline skills that complement our values to enable Managers to lead teams at GitLab. To date, there has not been a formal GitLab Manager training program and this will serve as our first iteration. 

**How will it help**

Learn the basic principles of what it means to be a manager using a whole person approach to leadership. The program was built to incorporate themes identified during interviews with team members and managers at GitLab. 

**What do I need to do**

Set aside time each day to participate in the challenge (20 minutes) and live learning sessions (1 hour). Complete the weekly self-evaluations and comment in the Slack channel during discussions. As a participant in the pilot program, your feedback is critical for our success so please make time to complete the weekly evaluations.
