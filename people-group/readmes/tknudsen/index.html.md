## Flaws

- Tendency to overextend self: I love to be helpful, and tend to always say yes to anything I can help with.  Sometimes I need to be reminded that I don't need to take everything on by myself. 
- Iteration: Iteration is a value here at GitLab, and I always strive to iterate.  That being said, it is the value I struggle with most.  I tend to always drive for perfection, and I sometimes hesitate to suggest an idea, hit the merge button, or create an issue unless I feel the idea is perfected. I am always attempting to approve in this aspect, and if you ever see me hesitating, please give me a nudge to action/suggest the idea soonest.
- Feedback: I love getting feedback, though I do not tend to ask for it, or give it.  If you see anything I can improve on, or something that I should continue to do, please give me the feedback.  Also if you are seeking feedback from me, do not hesistate to ask.  I am always working on getting better at providing and asking for feedback.
- Multi-tasking: I am good and taking notes and jotting down things that I need to pick up later, but I do tend to get overwhelmed if too much is thrown at me at once without the ability to prioritize and notate for later.  If I am mid-conversation on one topic, I do get confused if the topic suddently jumps without warning.  
- Timekeeping: For Zoom meetings, this is not too much of an issue, however for in person meetings, I have the mentality that if I'm on time, I'm late. This often leads me to being at meetings, events, or conferences early, and causes me to stress more before events.  I am working on this, and am doing my best to realize that I do not always need to be early.

## Communication

Here are my preferences for ad hoc communications with me:

- Not confidential action items: Slack `@tknudsen` in a public channel (recommended channels include #eba-team, and #peopleops)
- Confidential: Slack @tknudsen in a private channel (create a private channel and invites others as necessary, if needed)
- Confidential to me only: DM Slack `@tknudsen`, or email at `tknudsen@gitlab.com`
- Social/fun: Slack or Zoom please! If you happen to be near where I reside, in person is also great!  Try to avoid email, I like to keep my inbox clean as much as possible.
- Urgent, important, needs conversation: /zoom on Slack via DM
