# Ta-New-Ki Welcome Call (Pre-Onboarding)

The People Experience Team hosts a pre-onboarding call known as the Ta-New-Ki call (a play on the abstract Tanuki i.e. Japanese raccoon dog you will find in our logo).  The purpose of this call, which is hosted in Zoom, is to give soon to onboard team members the chance to meet / socialise and to provide an opportunity to ask any lingering questions ahead of their start date.  Internally we refer to this as an AMA (Ask Me Anything) call. **This call is open to all current team members, hiring managers.** 

This call occurs every two weeks on Monday at two times to account for timezones. 
- 12:00am PT
- 08:30am PT
For current team members: To add the invite to your calendar, review the GitLab Team Meeting Calendar. 
For future team members: You will recieve an email with the future dates. 

Please note that this call will take a place a week or two before your actual start date. 

Sending out the Invite:
- Invites are sent by the People Experience Associate.
- Use this [email template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/email_templates/TaNewKi%20Welcome%20Call)
- The email is sent out to upcoming hires one week before the call. 
- Be sure to cc the People Experience Team on the outgoing email.
- The People Experience Team can check who will be attending the call by looking at the Google Form.

# Onboarding at GitLab

Onboarding is [incredibly important](/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/) at GitLab. We don't expect you to hit the ground running from day one.

We highly recommend taking at least two full weeks for onboarding and only in week three starting with team specific onboarding and training. Please feel free to participate in your team's work in your first two weeks, but don't feel like you have to contribute heavily.

All onboarding steps are in the [onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates-2/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding.md) which is owned by the People Experience Team. The onboarding process for the new team member is [self-driven and self-learning](/handbook/values/#self-service-and-self-learning), whilst also remaining as [asynchronous](/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication) as possible settling into the remote life at GitLab. 

Each onboarding issue has a main section that contains tasks relevant to all GitLab team-members and a due date of 30 days. Below the main section are department and role-specific tasks. Some roles and departments have tasks that link to a supplemental issue template or an additional onboarding page.  Reach out to your [onboarding buddy](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/) or other GitLab team members if you need help understanding or completing any of your tasks.

Through onboarding issues, you should gain access to our team member [baseline entitlements](/handbook/engineering/security/#baseline-role-based-entitlements-access-runbooks--issue-templates). On Day 2 of onboarding an [Access Request](/handbook/people-group/engineering/#access-request-issue-creation) will be generated, if a template has been created for the role. Access requests are owned by the IT team. If you have any access requests related questions, please reach out to #it-help in Slack.

## Onboarding Check-In Call
All new team members are invited to the Onboarding Check-In call. This call occurs every other Thursday in both an APAC/EMEA and an Americas friendly time. 

This call is available for new team members to ask questions about onboarding, benefits, and anything else they have not been able to find the answer to. It is an AMA (Ask Me Anything) style call. Coming prepared with questions is always encouraged.

## Slack Channel Support for New Team Members

By default, all new team members are added to the below Slack channels from day 1 to ensure that they are able to ask any questions or for assistance in the correct channels upfront:

- #new_team_members
- #peopleops
- #diversity_inclusion_and_belonging
- #it_help
- #expense-reporting-inquiries
- #payroll
- #questions
- #donut-be-strangers
- #team-member-updates
- #thanks
- #totalrewards
- #whats-happening-at-gitlab

## Managers of New Team Members 

An issue is created for new team members at least 4 business days prior to their start date. The Manager and a People Experience Associate will be assigned to this issue. **Managers, People Experience and IT Ops** all have tasks that need to be completed **prior to the start date** to ensure a smooth and successful onboarding process. For questions or help with any of these tasks feel free to reach out in the issue by mentioning `@people-exp` or adding a question in the `#peopleops` Slack channel. 

## Compliance 

The [People Experience Associate](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/people-ops/people-experience-associate/) completes a monthly audit of all open onboarding issues to ensure that the new team member, manager and People Experience team tasks are completed. More importantly, there are certain tasks which need to be completed  in line with our company compliance (security, payroll, etc).  

If any tasks are still outstanding, the People Experience Associate will ping the relevant members on the issue requesting action on the items or checking whether the issue can be closed. 

*It remains the responsibility of the People Experience Associate to close the issue and remain compliant.*

The employment bot will automatically close any onboarding issues still open after 60 days.

## Completing Onboarding Issue

To ensure a successful completion of the onboarding issue, it is important that all tasks are checked off, whether the task is applicable to the onboarding team member or not. Checking the box indicates one of the following:

* I have completed this task
* I have checked and this task is not applicable to me
