* **Candidate Profile Merge Requests**
   * Consider the following when merging candidate/prospect profiles:
      * Ensure that the Source, Coordinator, and Recruiter listed in the Details tab remains the same.
      * If a candidate is marked as *Hired*, ensure the profile that they were *Hired* on is the *Primary Profile*.
* **Offer Approvals**
    * The Offer Approvals process can be accessed in the [Greenhouse Handbook page](/handbook/hiring/greenhouse/#updating-requisition-and-offer-approval-flows)
* **Requisition Approvals**
    * To re-open a closed requisition and increase the opening count:
       1. Navigate to the *Approvals* tab, select `Edit Job & Openings`
       1. Navigate down to the *Openings* section and select `Add New`. 
       1. Once a new opening populates, manually add the Opening ID number. The `Hiring Manager` section should mirror the other openings.
       1. Verify with the recruiter if the opening is a Backfill or New Hire. Select `Reopen as Draft`.
       1. Restart the approval process by selecting `Request Approval`. Mark a Total Rewards approver as approved. Send a note to Finance to review the additional opening request. Be sure to cc the recruiter in that note.
* **Referral Submissions**
    * [See how to process Referral Submissions in the handbook.](/handbook/hiring/referral-operations/#transferring-referral-submissions-to-greenhouse)

### Project Access

The Recruiting Operations and Insights team audits users and access level permissions of the Recruiting group on a monthly basis.

### Reporting

To note: When preparing reports, please be mindful that **not** all roles are subject to a `Location Factor`. However, despite a role **not** being subject to one, we will still report it. The reason being is to have a comprehensive view of `Location Factors` in our hiring efforts. To accommodate this, two averages will be calculated; one of the overall average that **includes** all roles and another that **excludes** the roles where it is not applicable. 

Please see the list below of roles where `Location Factor` is **not** applicable:

This data is used to update the [Identity Data](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/identity-data/) page.

  CRM Metrics

* **System**: Greenhouse
* **Instructions**: Refresh the [Base] sheets, which are linked to Greenhouse via their *Google Sheets Connector*. Copy the data from the `[BASE] Prospect Conversion` and paste it into the `prospect_conversion_data` sheet, matching the existing columns. Filter the sheet by the `Converted to Candidate` column - remove "0" - then sort the sheet alphabetically by the `Prospect Pool` column. Combine all duplicates so that only aggregated pool information remains. Calculate the *Conversion Rate* (Converted to Candidate/Prospects in Pool/Stages) and use that information to update the `Historical Metrics` and `Pool Metrics` tabs. Secondly, copy the data from the `[Base] Prospecting Activity` sheet and paste that into the `prospecting_activity_data` sheet, matching the existing columns. Next, assign a *Role* to Recruiting Team Members **only** (e.g. *Recruiting Manager*, *Recruiter*, or *Sourcer*). Remove all "Blanks" from the `Role` column and calculate the *Conversion Rate* (Converted to Candidate/Prospects Added). Reference that range when updating the chart on the `Historical Metrics` tab.

  Sourcing Metrics
  </summary>

* **System**: Greenhouse
* **Instructions**: This report is a complilation of multiple linked reports via the *Greenhouse Report Connector* tool. Refresh all reports via that connector and enter the current monthly data into the appropriate columns in the following tabs: `Source (Month/Month)`, `Sources & Percentages`, and `Quality (Month/Month)`. Please see the list below for additional action items, where applicable.
     * `Source (Month/Month)`: Simply update the appropriate values that correspond to each source.
         * If a new source needs to be added, insert a new row in the appropriate **Source Category** (e.g. *Prospecting*) and enter its values.
         * Given the current Outbound model, there should be **no** candidates with the source, `Jobs page on your website`. If there are, please take the following steps to audit their source:
             1. Run the [New Candidates by Source](https://gitlab.greenhouse.io/reports/new_candidates_by_source?term=&job_status=all&user_role_on_jobs=any_role&include_template_jobs=0&date_relative=current_month&summarize=month&include_migrated_candidates=1&hide_empty_rows=false) report (Filters: `Job Status = All`; `Date = Current Month`; [X] Include Migrated Candidates)
             1. Go to the **All Candidates** tab and set the following filters:
                 * **Clear** the default filters (`Active` and `Open Jobs`)
                 * Apply `Source = Jobs page on your website` 
                 * Apply `Applied On = [Current Month]`
                 * For each candidate that appears, check their respective *Activity Feeds* to see how they came to be in their current requisition.
                     * For example, if a Recruiting Team Member moved the candidate to the current requisition, then the candidate's source should likely be `Greenhouse Sourcing`.
     * `Sources & Percentages`: Update the appropriate values that correspond to each source. Then, referencing the *Hiring Speed per Candidate* report, determine the total number of **Outbound Offer Accepts** and the **Total Offer Accepts**. The percentage will update automatically as well as the charts if the month remains the same.
         * When adding a new month, create two new columns, copying their formatting, and update the chart's range.
     * `Quality (Month/Month)`: Simply update the appropriate values that correspond to each source.

In the Issue, please provide the requested information and as much detail as possible. For example, what the service is for, how many licenses will be needed, and the like. With that, the Recruiting Operations & Insights will takeover and prepare either a [Procurement Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/issues/new) for approval and see to its conclusion.
