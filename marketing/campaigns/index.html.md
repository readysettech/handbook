## Integrated Campaigns

The goal of GitLab integrated campaigns is to strategically land a cohesive message to a target audience across a variety of channels and offers dependent on the goals of the campaign. Content types include a combination of blog posts, webinars, whitepapers, reports, videos, case studies, and more. Channels include digital ads, social, paid social, SEO, PR, email, and more.

**Marketing Program Managers** are responsible for the strategizing of integrated campaigns and organizing timelines and DRIs for deliverables to execute on the campaigns.

In an effort to continually improve our ability to derive success of campaigns, reporting is a focus using Bizible data in Sisense. [Issue here for more information on progress](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/issues/982)

**Questions? Please feel free to ask in the [#marketing_programs slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CCWUCP4MS) or ask in the [#marketing slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C0AKZRSQ5) and tag @marketing-programs.**

## Campaign Planning

**There will be an epic for every campaign - created by the Marketing Program Manager managing the campaign - and a content pillar will align to the campaign, including gated assets to be created, pages to be created/revamped, blog posts, etc.**

* The campaign will have a clear launch date
* The new resources and webpages will have a clear due date prior to the launch date or defined for a cascading roll-out of content post-launch
* All action items will have DRIs and a timeline, working back from the launch date
* The campaign will be determined at least 45 days prior to launch to allow for a proactive, not reactive, timeline

Ideally, campaigns will be agreed at least a quarter in advance to allow for ample planning and execution, prep time with agencies, creative concepting, and communication internally. This is a collaborative effort to deliver a cohesive program.

#### Overall Campaign Steps
* **Campaign and launch date is determined by Marketing Leadership**
* **Assign:** Marketing Progragm Manager (MPM) is assigned
* **Assign:** Marketing team leaders assign DRIs from their teams
* **Meeting:** MPM organizes campaign kickoff call with early-stage DRIs (MPM, DMP, PMM, TMM)
* **Meeting:** MPM organizes campaign brief call with early-stage DRIs (MPM, DMP, PMM, TMM)
* **Plan:** MPM creates project plan (GANTT chart) with timelines and DRIs
* **Plan:** Marketing Program Manager creates the epic and related issues, including the due dates and DRIs from project plan
* **Meeting:** MPM organizes the bi-weekly 30 minute check-in call to cover milestones met and determine any blockers/at-risk action items
* **Async:** *DRIs are responsible for delivering by their due dates, with timeline adherence being critical due to dependencies for later tasks to be completed by other teams*
* **Reporting:** MPM organizes reporting issue with clear DRI to include overall metrics and more detailed drill-in by channel (one month post-launch)
* **Optimization:** MPM creates issues for optimizing the landing page, channels, etc. and assigning to relevant DRIs

## SDR follow up process

### ðŸ”” About the inbound leads

* **What did they do?** They filled out a form on the [campaign page]()
* **What did they get from the form?** They will <watch our on-demand webcast OR view our eBook OR register for our live webcast OR etc.> "<Asset Name>" in a Pathfactory experience that provides like-minded <topic/use case> content.
* **Are they MQLs?** If filling out the form makes them reach the 90 point threshold, they will MQL.
* **What if they don't hit the threshold?** They will receive additional related assets via a [bi-weekly email nurture campaign in Marketo](link-to-nurture-issue). As they engage more, their score increases toward the 90 point threshold.

### :information_desk_person: Great... so where do I see these leads in SFDC?

In an effort to keep you focused on the prioritized lead and contact views, an **Interesting Moment** is triggered from Marketo.

**Interesting Moment to Look For: `<Name> Campaign - downloaded <asset type> "<Asset Name>"`**

#### Please prioritize lead AND contacts views per normal SLAs:
*  [My P2 - MQL excl SaaS trials](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00Q?fcf=00B4M000004oR0o)
*  [My P4 - MQL - Trial SaaS](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00Q?fcf=00B4M000004oR0o)
*  [My P7 - Inquiry](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00Q?fcf=00B4M000004oR0o)
*  [My P8 - Stale MQLs or Nurture](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00Q?fcf=00B4M000004Zcsp&rolodexIndex=-1&page=1) with new last interesting moment

*If they are in salesadmin / raw status / legacy AE owned, managers will monitor these leads for re-routing.*

### :large_blue_circle: MASTER|Inbound sequence for each region

* [NORAM](add-link-to-outreach-noram)
* [EMEA](add-link-to-outreach-noram)
* [APAC](add-link-to-outreach-noram)

**Note: These master sequences all have the same steps and copies, the only difference is the delivery schedules are aligned to each region's weekday business hours.*

Note: The Marketing Team owns content on marketing pages; do not change content or design of these pages without consulting the #dmpteam slack channel. Marketing will request help from product/UX when we need it, and work with them to ensure the timeline is reasonable.


## Sales Lead Funnel Cross-Over with All-Remote


#### Diagram of sales lead funnel cross-over with all-remote

Below is a V1 visual in Mural of the sales lead funnel (pre-opportunity) on the left and the all-remote funnel on the right. Discussion of how and when to "bridge the gap" between the funnels - potentially sharing GitLab audience-targeted offers within All-Remote communications - is included [in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/2590).
