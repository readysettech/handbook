## Introduction

This page contains guidelines for localization at GitLab. This page is maintained by the Global Content team. 

## Overview 

GitLab is a global company that does business around the world. In order to best serve our global customers, we localize our content and campaigns into native languages. 

## Current State

Our current localization capablities are limited due to resources and bandwidth. Currently, we are focused on translating content that aligns to our P0 countries. Additionally, we are enabling our field marketing teams to get lighweight translations that don't require internal development or design resources. 

### Internal Reviews

To ensure translated content makes contextual and technical sense, we have internal native language speakers review the content. Internal reviewers **are expected** to review content for accuracy and quality and identify small mistakes made by the translator. Internal reviewers **are not expected** to copyedit or rewrite documents. If the quailty of a translated document is poor and needs to be written, the reviewer should stop reading and let the requestor know that the translation is not usable and provide a reason why. The requestor should provide this feedback to the translator. 

**Guidelines for reviewers**

1. Identify copy mistakes.
1. Identify areas where the context did not translate well and needs more attention. 
1. Identify words or phrases that should **not** be translated. 
1. If by the third second page it is clear that the translation is too poor to be used, stop reading and let the requestor know that translation is not usable and should be resumbitted. 

#### Process for requesting a review

1. Open a [translation review request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/growth-marketing/global-content/content-marketing/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=#) 
1. Complete all requested fields in the issue.

### Translated URL structure

All translated pages live in a sub-folder dedicated to a specific language. These sub-folders use [ISO 639-1 codes] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). For example, German pages live in the `/de/` sub-folder.

### hreflang tagging
Search engines use the `hreflang` tag to determine a canonical version for translated pages. 

`hreflang` tags start with declaration `<link rel="alternate"`, adds URL `href={{url}}`, and ends with `hreflang={{language ISO}}`

Example of a hreflang tag for a URL translated to German.

`<link rel="alternate" href="https://about.gitlab.com/de/warum/nutze-continuous-integration-fuer-schnelleres-bauen-und-testen/" hreflang="de" />`

We set the hreflang when needed in the frontmatter for a page with the language specific ISO Code, in German for example `frontmatter: de`.
