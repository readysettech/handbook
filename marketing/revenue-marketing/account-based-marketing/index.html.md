## What is account based marketing?
Account-based marketing is a strategic approach to marketing based on account awareness in which an organization considers and communicates with individual prospect or customer accounts as markets of one.  Through a close strategic alignment between sales and marketing, we focus on target accounts that fit our ICP (ideal customer profile). 

## Where does account based marketing fit within the greater marketing org?
Account based marketing sits next to field marketing and is similarly aligned to sales.  Account based marketing looks at an account or target account as a market of one, versus marketing to the total addressable market or to a specific region.  This type of marketing is executed by the account based team whereas field marketing is focused on lead gen and account centric marketing.

## What does account based marketing look like at GitLab and what is the team responsible for?
The account based marketing team is responsible for all account based marketing strategies, finding and targeting our ideal customer, and managing our ideal customer profile.  You can think of this team as sitting next to all other marketing functions and marketing to our highest value target accounts utilizing and building on the other marketing efforts already in motion.
- development and maintenance of our GL4300 and MM4000 target lists
- development and iteration of our ideal customer profile
- account based marketing strategy to our strategic accounts

# Account Based Marketing Focus
The account based marketing team is responsible for marketing to a strategic subset of agreed upon accoutns with in the GL4300 and the MM4000.  We also focus roughly 15% on strategic expansion opportunities with existing customers.  We have three different tiers in our account based strategy:

### Tier 1 (1:1 or strategic) - ICP accounts
**Our highest value target accounts.  Will include 5-10 accounts at any given time globally and are designed as 1:1 campaigns**

### Tier 2 (1:few or scale)-Like accounts based on a certain number of target account qualifiers
**Will include roughly 50 accounts at any given time globally.  These accounts will receive an orchestration play that is a medium lift and focused on like accounts.  This means there may be three different campaigns running in the segment, focused on a set of accounts rather than customized to a single account.**

### Tier 3 (1:many or programmatic)- Accounts we would like to target but without the personalize plan or resources
**Will include 75-100 accounts globally at any given time. These accounts will have a digital campaign based on use case along with light email and SDR support**

## When does an account get added to our account based marketing strategy or move tiers?
The account based marketing team will be monitoring accounts in all tiers and adjusting the level of marketing support for these accounts based on the accounts tiering qualifications.  For an example, if an account is currently in tier 3 and then meets all of tier 2 qualifications, that account will be moved to tier 2.  Additionally, the account team will be notified and brought in to strategize and engage in the marketing plan appropriately.

Accounts can also move tiers by being nominated by sales and accepted by the account based team.  This is done through completing this [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/account-based-marketing/-/issues/new#) and assigning it to @emilyluehrs.  The account will be evaluated by the account based team which has an SLA for a decision within 5 business days of the issue being submitted.  Accounts are reviewed quarterly in line with the GL4300 & MM 4000 to ensure we are in line with company goals.

## Other times when accounts will move
As our ICP iterates (we will be reviewing in July 2020 and then annually after that) we will be moving accounts into the account based strategy and could also be removing accounts or moving them to a lower tier.  This could be because the intent signals have dropped to a level that does not support a custom marketing plan, or the sales team is not supporting the marketing plan as needed.  An explanation will always be given if an account is moved to a different tier or removed from our account based strategy altogether.

## Prepping an account for account based marketing
If an account is selected for an ABM campaign there are some clean up/prep todo's that need to happen before the account can be added.  This is done in the ABM nomination issue OR as part of the data clean up by the account owner prior to the start of the campaign.

## SDR<>ABM Alignment
As the account based team is focused on our high value accounts, it is natural to pair our acceleration team with the account based team to help accelerate the overall opportunity.  Beginning Q2 FY21, we will be pairing the acceleration team and account-based team in order to align our most senior SDRâ€™s to our highest value accounts while also solving for the need to accelerate sales onboarding and warming up sales territories.  In parallel, we will also be incorporating the mapped SDR team in region into the plan and motions of the acceleration teams so as to encourage the transition to more acceleration based tactics across the entire organization, utilizing the intent data and other tools through the account based team. Detailed information about the ABM SDR workflow can be found on the [SDR handbook page](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/#abm-acceleration-team).

## Account Based Marketing workflow & labels in GitLab   

The ABM team works from issues and issue boards. If you are needing our assistance with any project, please open an issue and tag us using the ~Account Based Marketing label anywhere within the GitLab repo.
