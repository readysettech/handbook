## Virtual Workshop

This section focuses on best practices, timelines and logistical set up for a Field Marketing-run Virtual Workshop.

## Ownership of workshop tasks 

* Project Management in GitLab (epic, issue, timeline creation): FMM/Workshop requestor 
* Zoom license calendar schedule: Campaign Manager
* Landing page and email copy (templated with limited customization, if any): FMM/FMC/Workshop requestor 
* Marketo program, SFDC program, landing page, email creation: Campaign Manager
* Zoom setup and integration: Campaign Manager
* Host dry run and run day-of event Zoom meeting: FMM/Workshop requestor 
* Day of event moderator: SAL / PMM / ISR 

Definitions throughout this page:  
* Host = Person running the webcast from the technical side (start the webcast, push polls, push notifications to attendees through chat).  
* Moderator = The on-screen MC of the webcast (welcomes attendees, introduces presenters, reads questions from audience to the presenter to answer)


## Securing a virtual workshop date on webcast calendar

* Workshop requester will submit a [zoom date request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/new?issuable_template=zoom-license-date-request)
* Marketing Programs will triage the date against the zoom webcast license calendar to make sure there is no overlapping virtual event that has been pre-scheduled
* If the suggested date is feasible, does not over-saturate the calendar, AND the speaker(s) have been secured, the Campaign Manager will reserve on the calendar and close out the date request issue. At a minimum, there needs to be an MC and a lead SA assigned in order for the Campaign Manager to be able to secure a date. 

## Workshop Epic Code

## Workshop Set-up

### Logistical Set up 
Instructions for workshop Zoom / Marketo / SFDC set-up can be found on the [webcasts handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/webcast/#logistical-set-up) page.

There are only minor modifications to those instructions.

#### Zoom confirmation email
After creating the workshop in Zoom, click `Email Settings` then select `Edit` next to "Confirmation Email to Registrants  Send upon registration". In the first open text field, add the following: "To help us understand the audience better and tailor the workshop content, please complete the pre-event survey: [enter survey link for workshop type here]"

* [DevOps Automation pre-event survey](https://forms.gle/iC2N2Ltji6DXdyjg8)
* [Project / Program Management pre-event survey](https://forms.gle/CAb3ZR1WeURxrbXU7)
* [Security pre-event survey](https://forms.gle/D7aAXvo6mPss4HyK8) 

As normal, Zoom should be configured to send the confirmation and day/hour prior emails.

#### LIVE webcast registration and tracking

##### Set up the webcast in Marketo/SFDC, and integrate to Zoom

This includes the program, SFDC, Zoom, landing pages, and emails as they are templatized to operate from the Marketo My Tokens level.

1. Create the workshop program in Marketo by cloning the appropriate Marketo program for the type of workshop:
    * [DevOps Automation Workshop program template](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#ME5871A1).
    * [Security Workshop program template](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#ME5923A1).
    * [Project/Program Management Workshop program template](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#ME5927A1).
    * Complete the rest of the steps as outlined on the [webcast handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/webcast/#step-2-set-up-the-webcast-in-marketosfdc-and-integrate-to-zoom) page. Note there are more tokens to complete for the workshop and details for each are contained in the token value area.
1. Create the Marketo landing page - [follow these instructions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/webcast/#step-3-create-the-landing-page)

##### Add the workshop to the /events page
*  To add the workshop to the /events page follow this [step by step guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/events/#how-to-add-events-to-aboutgitlabcomevents).

##### Test your set up

1. Submit a test lead using your gitlab email on the LIVE landing page to make sure the registration is tracked appropriately in the Marketo program and you get a confirmation email from zoom.

#### Workshop invitations

1. Once the tokens are updated in Marketo, the invitation and sales-nominated emails should be ready.
2. Approve copy and send samples to the FMM for review and approval.
3. Once approved, activate the sales-nominated invite to send each weekday until the day of the workshop.
3. Go to the Lists folder and edit the `Target List` smart list and input the targets provided by FMM (typically in the copy doc).
4. Once you get approval on the sample email copy, schedule the email programs.

#### Workshop registration caps and closing registration

The GitLab demo environment can support 200 users at one time. Currently, the Virtual Workshops have approximately a 40-50% attendance rate, which means registration must be capped at 350 registrations, max. 

In order to cap registration, we remove the registration form on the Landing Page in Marketo. To do this:

1) Turn off the form variable on the landing page by toggling the "Temp Hide From" variable to "Hidden"
2) Add sold out language by toggling "Hero 2 Visibility" to Visible


#### Pre-event demo environment demo code
1. Populate the {{my.democode}} token with the code provided by the FMM in the copy document.
2. Provide the sample email to the workshop owner for final review.
3. 3-4 days prior to the workshop, send the `Week prior - Demo code for registrants (operational)` to all registrants. Note that this email is operational as it provides a demo code necessary for the workshop.
   - Note that this started as a week prior email, but we are currently testing a few days prior (in the same week, after the weekend) to see if there are fewer login issues on this schedule.

#### Post LIVE workshop
   * Follow the instructions on the [webcast handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/webcast/#post-live-webcast) page. 
 
##### On-Demand for Workshops

We do not offer the webcast recording on demand.  However, we do provide a link to the slides via Pathfactory in the attendee follow-up email. This will be auto-populated in the follow-up email through the Marketo tokens.

## Field Marketing Process: How to Execute a Virtual Workshop 

### Pre-Event Set Up 

1. Review the current workshops and identify if what is offered meets your criteria or if a new workshop needs to be created to meet your objectives.   
**Current Workshops available include:**      
   - [**DevOps Automation Workshop:**](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1337) This is a basic 101 introduction to GitLab designed to encourage customers to try us out and move sales from considering to buying.    
   - [**Program and Portfolio Management Workshop:**](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1334) This workshop is designed to assist project and portfolio teams to gain first hand knowledge into the teams and projects aligned with ongoing business initiatives when using GitLab. 
   - [**Security Workshop:**](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1336) This workshop is intended to be a hands-on event for existing and new users of GitLab. Its focus is Security / Shifting Left.
   - [**CI/CD**](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1335) - Content Coming Soon. 
1. Identify if a workshop is currently planned that might support your needs. [Click here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/#gitlab-virtual-events-calendar) to view calendar of scheduled events.
1. Work with Customer Success team (SAs) to identify the lead instructors/presenters. You must have your lead instructor identified at this time and work together to select a date.  
1. Once a date has been confirmed, Lead SA must coordinate with the Demo Systems Engineer (Jeff Martin) to obtain the demo environment redemption code and discuss SLAs to ensure demo meets code requirements.
1. If the audience is account centric, if you are not doing paid social media, or need your own workshop due to your account goals, consider [Self-Service without Promotion](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/self-service-ve-with-without-promotion/#logistical-set-up). Sales can run on their own, or with field marketing. If not, then it would qualify as a Webcast. [Click here for virtual events decision tree for more information.](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/#gitlab-virtual-events-decision-tree)   
1. Work with the Sales Team to identify who your Moderator (MC) will be; recommend this be one of your SALs. Moderator will set the tone for the workshop as well as introduce presenters throughout the event and announce poll questions/answers.
1. Create a [webcast date request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/new?issuable_template=zoom-license-date-request).
   - The date reservation request must be submitted no less than 32 business days prior to event date for existing copy or content and 45 days prior to the event date for new copy or content.  
   - For workshops, the moderator and lead SA must be secured in order to reserve the date.
   - The Campaign Manager team will follow the process outlined on the [webcast page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/virtual-workshops/#securing-a-virtual-workshop-date-on-webcast-calendar)to assign the date.  
1. Once you have obtained a Webcast date and Dry Run date from Digital Marketing Team (Campaign Manager), then create a Field Marketing issue for a virtual workshop utilizing the [Virtual Workshop Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Virtual_Workshop_Template).
1. FMM will ping FMC to create epic and related issues (linked in [epic code](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/virtual-workshops/#workshop-epic-code)), including the following optional issues:
   - Organic Social Media 
   - Paid Social Media 
   - New design assets issue for design
1. FMC will assign the due dates in the issues according to the [workback schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXriQ1clvYyBn-TDbbCVvNP6NEbrAF-0w6tIHKhDeZM/edit#gid=1983708280)   
1. FMM to open the following issues which are not tied to the epic (optional but highly recommended):
   - [Account Based Marketing Request for Demand Base Display Ads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/account-based-marketing/-/issues/new#) If you select this option, you will need to work with Sales Teams to decide who your target audience is before completing the request to ABM Team. Ads need to be created by design and handed to Demandbase for launch of the campaign. Note the time to launch estimate specified in this issue does not include the SLA for design.  
   - [Template for Certification of Completion](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1D9ReKCU7dhbHbkLotKgh4D7dZZ9m2IHS)   
1. Review Marketing Copy Doc - Update copy for landing page, emails, update the times, dates, redemption code in the 1-week reminder emails. Note that changes to the landing page or email copy will require the 45 day SLA noted above for new copy/content.
   - If new content: Work with Presenters/Instructors to create presentation slides, labs, demos, as well as copy for landing page and emails. 
   - If existing content: Work with Presenters/Instructors to update presentation slides. 
1. FMM DRI to work together on developing the script for MC within the Dry Run document utilizing the [Dry Run Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzNkJnwlVOB1vw4yvgXtIxtddfw_x4u7WC9xAqSVEHM/edit?ts=5f2414fd). 
   - FMM also needs to compile Presenter’s Bio’s to include in the script for MC to announce as a brief introduction during the workshop before they begin their portion. 
   - For more details, please review the [Workshop Dry Run and Q&A Section](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/virtual-workshops/#workshop-dry-run-and-qa) below.
1. FMM to fill out [Dry Run Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzNkJnwlVOB1vw4yvgXtIxtddfw_x4u7WC9xAqSVEHM/edit?ts=5f2414fd) with roles/responsibilities/quick links and more. 
1. FMM will need to create the [Intro and Transition Slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19BD2fZ2fN1AcvWo-Xf9bEL8AR8R6sYxY1s2aA6gfEF4/edit) and Lead SA to create remaining Workshop slides and udpate content in the Workshop Google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qAymFTiXFEk-lRSNreIhaZ6Z62fdo_y2). 
1. Pre-Event and Post- Event Surveys
   - Update/Create Pre-event survey questions and google form. [Click here for an Example](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCSyq1cZj6H4ucKEnSDuDKulXkz_WXo0r7PJ4pO721Tuz0QQ/viewform)  
   - Update/Create Post event survey questions and google form.  [Click here for an Example](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI7ZTGup36lPyj3U-DpaLeev6yHcqahkUOFZ8Z9SrYBLkSIA/viewform)  
1. Create/Review polling questions for the event. Reference Parent Epic for suggestions/previous polling questions/when to launch and more.  
1. Sales Nomination Information:  The Sales Nomination process is critical to the success of the workshop as a sales tool to nudge accounts across the finish line or create conversation points. Video instructions on how to Sales Nominate can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QNB3DXXWtnmMBvzeHPkT7cRmigJdIWq5).  Best practices can be identified in the epic but the FMM will need assign due dates in the invite issue according to the [workback schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXriQ1clvYyBn-TDbbCVvNP6NEbrAF-0w6tIHKhDeZM/edit#gid=1983708280) to request the email is ready at least two weeks prior to the marketing email invites. 
1. Once a date is set with the Lead SA and FMM, continue to work with the Customer Success/SA teams to confirm who will lead each session, confirm 2-3 additional SAs for Q&A and provide the complete team in the [Dry run issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/new?issuable_template=webcast-scheduling-dry-run), tagging the appropriate Campaign Manager.
1. Create Internal Triage Document ([example Question Triage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H1Dre7Vc-iBom-eWYqgEBkx7Q58u2fMI-uXZdG53EpI/edit)) to house questions/responses from the event. 
1. Create Event Slack Channel for the team to discuss details, logistics, etc. 
1. Create Q&A Slack Channel for the event (example channel: [#2020-virtual-workshop-qa](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C017TMC32EQ)). 
   - Field Marketing helps support by placing questions in the channel for Question Coordinator (Lead SA) to assign SAs to answer the question. The slack channel allows other SAs to jump in if they have some free time in their day and it allows an easier point of discussion.  Once a question is answered, the Question Coordinator (Lead SA) will place the answer in the Q&A section of the Zoom webcast queue. 
1. If you have budget and would like to host a virtual raffle, please follow the following process: Select the items (recommend 3 prizes total) you’d like to give away. Include the items in the [Transition Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19BD2fZ2fN1AcvWo-Xf9bEL8AR8R6sYxY1s2aA6gfEF4/edit#slide=id.g7dd1ed64d9_0_5929) to have the MC announce at the beginning of the event and at the end. For those who attend the entire event will be eligible for the raffle. You will need to provide the attendees with a code word at the end of the event via the Chat feature in Zoom Webcast during the beginning of the Closing / Final Q&A portion of the event along with the URL to the post-event survey. In addition to adding a question at the end of the Post-Event Survey (click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc16eOijHQqrwBvx0Uk2SZRJeIjjCR6Xt2EICUZJm6UsEbh6Q/viewform) for example of post-event survey) that allows the attendees to enter the code word.

#### Workshop Dry Run and Q&A
* Q&A for the Virtual Workshops is handled via the Q&A feature of Zoom, due to the volume of questions received. We will tell attendees multiple times throughout the event to direct questions to Q&A.
* We do not use chat for attendees to communicate on this event. However, the Host will push webcast specific details via chat
* What we found works best is to have a person who coordinates the questions and answers. This person will copy questions from Q&A into the Slack channel determined during the dry run and any available SA will answer it in a thread. The Q&A coordinator should be someone from the SA team who can identify questions that are best to answer live, best to answer offline, and best to answer in writing.
* A coordinator makes it so we avoid answering over each other. We also have some canned responses that can be copied and pasted in. 
* The Q&A coordinator should be determined on the dry run and recorded in the dry run document. 

#### Details on how the Slack question management works
* Coordinator will copy all questions into Slack. 
* If a question looks good to answer live, mark it as “Answer Live” in Slack (so no one else starts work on it), then in the Q&A window.
* Only the Q&A Coordinator should enter answers into the Q&A box in Zoom. SAs will answer in the thread and indicate the answer is ready to give to attendees using the emoji system noted in the channel.
* If a question is marked to answer live, do not touch it until AFTER it is read and fully answered.
* “Answer Live” is the queue to the moderator to read that question out loud for the presenter. Do not select “Answer Live” until you want it answered (for example, you can select it if it is appropriate to answer during the next Q&A or even during a pause in the presentation. Do not select it if the moderator shouldn’t read it until a later presentation).
* Questions may be held in queue until the coordinator wants them answered. For example, a question may come up during the basics presentation that makes more sense to answer during the CI/CD session. The question will sit unanswered in the queue until then.
* Be comfortable with questions not being answered right away. It is up to the coordinator to determine when to answer and who will answer.
* Follow-up with attendees who we say we’ll follow-up with. The person responsible for follow-up will be determined during the dry run.
* Questions asked by attendees are not visible to other attendees until the answer is written. Answer live questions are visible.
* You may also dismiss questions by hovering over them and hitting “Dismiss”

### During Event 

FMM DRIs during the event are not only responsible for day of event coordination (virtually) but are also designated time keepers and hosts of the event.  

For more information about hosting a virtual hands-on workshop, please watch [**this training video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7L04-tQpJo&feature=youtu.be).

#### Day of Event Coordination 

- Q&A coordination throughout the event. This process is evolving, would advise using the [Question Triage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H1Dre7Vc-iBom-eWYqgEBkx7Q58u2fMI-uXZdG53EpI/edit) (included in the Dry Run Agenda Doc) to collect questions throughout the event and be able to document when submitting the list clean and upload issue. 
- Field Marketing helps support by placing questions in the designated slack channel for Question Coordinator (Lead SA) to assign SA’s to answer the question. The slack channel allows other SAs to jump in if they have some free time in their day and it allows an easier point of discussion.  Once a question is answered, the Question Coordinator (Lead SA) will place the answer in the Q&A section of the Zoom webcast queue.  
- FMMs will at times need to update the Introductions & Transitions Slide Deck with the accurate time of the break. This can be updated in advance but the presentations before the `Break` slide in the deck can run long or short due so advise for the FMM to update in real-time. 
- FMMs will need to list the following in the Chat feature of the Zoom Webcast live during the beginning of the Closing / Q&A section of the event once the MC announces the raffle prizes: 
   - Shortened URL of the Post-Event Survey
   - Code word to list in the Post-Event Survey for the attendees to be eligible to win one of the raffle prizes
   - Add promotion of upcoming workshop dates


#### Time Keepers 

FMMs will need to keep a close eye on the time. Notify the team and the next presenter when there time is nearing an end in the event’s slack channel (not the Q&A slack channel for the event) 

#### Workshop communication to attendees during event
* Each presenter will present from their own computer and share their screen.
* The moderator will show the agenda slide with demo instructions during the intro and welcome.
* When we go live, the host (person running the technical side of the webcast) will push the demo instructions to chat throughout the first two presentations. The exact copy is available in the dry run agenda because the specific demo code must be entered.
* Throughout the presentation, the host will also push a Q&A reminder to chat: "If you have any questions or technical issues, please use the Q&A function to submit your question."
* At the end of the session, the host will push the post-event survey through chat. The copy is available in the dry run agenda as the specific post-event survey link must be provided.

## Post-Event 

- Close out reporting
- Raffle award closing
- Close issue

### Closing out Workshops

Now that the event is over, it is important to consolidate all of the information points and upload them into Salesforce to streamline our sales follow up. The FMM DRI is responsible for consolidating the data from each of the attendees into the lead sheet. Consolidate data and include it in the Notes column to complete list clean and upload. This requires obtaining:
- The attendee list with contact information (Request exported report from Campaign Manager; until API Integration is solved) 
- The Post Event Survey results
- The data from Zoom Q&A queue (Request exported report from Campaign Manager)
- Workshop recordings should be posted to the [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dDyuT92zZOodi9mytf6--rq7kseX7EeE).



### How to consolidate the data:

1. **Attendee Report:** Download a copy from SFDC once the list is updated by the Campaign Manager.  The email address will be the key to consolidating the data. Load into the field marketing event template
1. **Post Event Survey:** Create a new worksheet in the Event template and put the Post event survey responses in a new worksheet
   - Consolidate the data points with Concatenate formulas. The formulas need to capture the question and the individual responses. For example: `=CONCATENATE($C$1&": "&C2&" | "&$D$1&": "&D2&" | "&$E$1&": "&E2&" | "&$F$1&": "&F2)` This will capture a summary for each question
   - Note: Sometimes google sheets can only build two or three questions before it stops working so you often need to build a few of these to capture all of the data points. If this happens build a final summary to put all of this together.
   - When this is complete, copy and paste values of  the final answer, into an empty column agencent to the email address. 
   - Now to Transfer Consolidated Post event Survey into Attendee list
     - To do this you are matching email addresses, and adding the values of the concatenated formulas from the Q&A sheet and entering it into the attendee sheet 
     - Move the values of the final concatenate formula from the last column to a column next to email addresses
     - In the attendee worksheet, use this vlookup  by going to the cell in the attendee sheet you want to populate and place this formula: `=VLOOKUP(C2,'Q&A'!E:F,2,False)` NOTE: you may need to adjust - Column E is email address, Column F is the consolidated data (in the Q&A sheet). The number 2 is the cell you want to upload into the attendee spreadsheet, and put False. 
     - Copy the value of the answer into the next column and mark as Q&A Value

### Raffle Awards Closing Process 

1. At the completion of the event, take the number of attendees and add them to a random number generator to select your winner(s).  You can choose how many times you would like to randomize, but usually 3 or 4 times will do it.  Select the number of winners based on your prizes from the top of the list.
1. Once the winner(s) have been selected, send an email ([click here for template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHGBy9VXEfp6cDDla56a31nChkR4BIv8rmhaii_SRNE/edit)) to the winner(s) to notify them that they’ve won and collect an address to ship the prize to. Option to CC the SAL who is tied to the account to allow them visibility / allow for possible follow up meeting. 
1. Once you have the responses from the winner(s), ship the prizes, delete the email with the address and if possible do not save the shipping address in your Amazon/Best Buy account or delete immediately after delivery.
