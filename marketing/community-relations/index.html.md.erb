## Our mission

At GitLab, our mission it to change all creative work from read-only to read-write so that [everyone can contribute](/company/strategy/#mission).

The Community Relations team supports this mission by working with our community to ensure they receive support and recognition for contributing to GitLab. Contributing to GitLab can include blog posts, code, documentation, discussions on forums/social media, meetups, presentations, translations, UX design, and more. We also support educational institutions and open source projects to host their work on GitLab.
