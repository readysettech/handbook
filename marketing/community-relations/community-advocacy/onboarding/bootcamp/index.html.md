## Bootcamp Checklist for Training of New Community Advocates
<a name="checklist"></a>

Your manager should create an issue with this checklist on the [community advocacy issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-advocacy/general/issues) for you as part of your onboarding.
This list looks strange in this handbook because it is formatted to be copy-pasted into an issue and then render properly there.

The topics are generally ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled,
but feel free to work on later things in the list when you are waiting on something.

```markdown
We need to keep iterating on this checklist so please submit MR's for any improvements
that you can think of. The file is located in
[`source/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-advocacy/onboarding/checklist/index.html.md`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/master/source/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-advocacy/onboarding/checklist/index.html.md)
in the [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/) project. If an item does not start with a role or name of someone else, it's yours to do.

**Goal of this entire checklist:** Set a clear path for Community Advocacy training

### Stage 0: Complete general onboarding to have all necessary accounts and permissions

- [ ] **Done with Stage 0**

_Typically completed within first week_

1. [ ] General expectations: it is expected that you will _start_ to tackle Stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 as early as your first week, but you are not expected to complete all items for some number of weeks. We believe that you often learn best and fastest by diving into (relatively easy) tickets, and learning by doing. However, this has to be balanced with making time to learn some of the tougher topics. The expectation is therefore that you are sufficiently advanced in your onboarding by the end of your first week, that you can answer 2-5 "simple" tickets. Over the following weeks, your manager will set higher targets for the number and difficulty of tickets to be tackled, but you should always have about 2-3 hrs per day to spend on working through this bootcamp. Some days it will be less, some days it will be more, depending on ticket load and how deep "in the zone" you are in either the bootcamp or the tickets you are responding to; but an average of 2-3 hrs per day should allow you to complete everything through to the end of Stage 6 within about four weeks.
1. [ ] General Onboarding Checklist: this should have been created for you on [the People Ops Employment issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/employment/-/issues/) as an issue by PeopleOps when you were hired.
   1. [ ] Finish every item on that list starting with `New team member:` until you are waiting for someone to answer a question or do something before you can continue that list.
   1. [ ] Start with Stage 1 here, but also with the first steps in Stage 2 and Stage 3.
   1. [ ] Check back daily on what was blocking you on your General Onboarding Checklist until that list is completely done, then focus on this one.

### Stage 1: Become familiar with `git`, GitLab basics, and start exploration of Zendesk.

- [ ] **Done with Stage 1**

_Typically started in first week, completed by end of second week_

## Zendesk:

1. [ ] Check with your manager that you've been given Agent Access to the Community Advocate Zendesk instance.
1. [ ] Quickly check out your Zendesk account to confirm you can login. Explore which platforms are piped into the Zendesk ticket views.
1. [ ] Under your profile on Zendesk, it should read `Admin`. If it reads `Agent` or `Light Agent`, inform your manager.
1. [ ] Add a [profile picture](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203690996-Updating-your-user-profile-and-password#topic_rgk_2z2_kh) to your Zendesk account
1. [ ] [Add Facebook to one of your personal views on Zendesk](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-advocacy/tools/zendesk/#view-limits-workaround).
1. [ ] Open an [Access Request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/)to be added as a ['Light Agent' on the Support Zendesk Instance](/handbook/support/internal-support/#viewing-support-tickets). Advocates use this instance to check in on support tickets inquired about over Twitter.

## Git and GitLab Basics:

If you are already comfortable with using Git and GitLab and you will be able to
retain a good amount of information by just reading and watching through, that is
okay. But if you see a topic that is completely new to you, stop the video and try
it out for yourself before continuing.

Cover these topics on the [GitLab University](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/university/):

1. [ ] Under the topic of Git
  1. [ ] [About Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16sX7hUrCZyOFbpvnrAFrg6tVO5_yT98IgdAqOmXwBho/edit#slide=id.gd69537a19_0_14)

  1. [ ] [GitLab Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGotqAUACZA)
  1. [ ] Take a look at how the different GitLab versions [compare](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/self-managed/feature-comparison/)
1. [ ] Any of these that you don't feel comfortable with in the [user training](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/tree/master/doc/university/training) we use for our customers.
  1. [ ] `env_setup.md`
  1. [ ] `feature_branching.md`
  1. [ ] `explore_gitlab.md`
  1. [ ] `stash.md`
  1. [ ] `git_log.md`
  1. [ ] For the rest of the topics in `user training`, just do a quick read over the file names so you start remembering where to find them.
1. [ ] Get familiar with the services GitLab offers
  1. [ ] The differences between [CE and EE](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
  1. [ ] [GitHost](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-hosted/)

#### Learn about raising issues and fielding feature proposals

1. [ ] Understand what's in the pipeline and proposed features at GitLab: [Direction Page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/)
