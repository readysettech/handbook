### GitLab Customer Advisory Boards
**Purpose:** To help foster DevOps transformation and adoption we are establishing a Customer Advisory Board, where we focus on sharing DevOps best practices and lessons learned with each other. We believe that transparency and sharing  is a key way to help encourage the success of DevOps transformations.  The GitLab customer advisory board is intended to be home to learning and collaboration so we can all experience success through DevOps transformation.

**Members** Executives/Champions for DevOps within their organizations

**Frequency:**  We meet virtually the first Wednesday of the month at 11 a.m. Eastern

**Membership:** As of July 2020, 31 customers, GitLab product team, UX team, Customer Success leadership

**Meeting Recordings** Meetings are recorded for internal and member use. Members can seek these recordings by emailing CAB@gitlab.com

**Recurring Content** We will frequently ask for GitLab Product Managers to join to [present the vision for their assigned DevOps stage](/product/#customer-advisory-board-meetings).
When doing so we will distribute a recorded video of their [stage direction](/handbook/product/product-processes/#section-and-stage-direction) in advance.

**Recorded CAB meetings** Due to the private nature of the Customer Advisory Board, video recordings and presentations are not linked here. If you are a GitLab employee, search for "Customer Advisory Board" in the google drive to view all assets.
