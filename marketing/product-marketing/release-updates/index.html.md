## Past updates

### Version 12 Year in Review

Leading into the GitLab 13.0 launch, [this blog post, including a video and slide deck](/blog/2020/05/21/version-12-year-in-review/) reviewed versions 12.0–12.10.

Major product themes are more apparent over this year of GitLab versions than they generally are in one month or quarter. For GitLab 12.x, these include "treating developers, security, and operations alike as first-class citizens in DevOps" and expanding the definition of DevOps and its practitioners, for example by building in Design Management and Requirements Management.

### 12.3–12.8 Sales enablement

This product release update covered 12.3–12.8 for FY21 Q1 and FY20 Q4, and was delivered 2020-02-27:

> GitLab 12.0 marks a key step in our journey to create an inclusive approach to DevSecOps, empowering 'everyone to contribute'.
>  
>  We believe everyone can contribute, and we’ve enabled cross-team collaboration, faster delivery of great code, and bringing together Dev, Ops, and Security.

</figure>

### 11.0 Launch

The theme of our 11.0 launch was [Auto DevOps](/auto-devops) (as it had been for 10.0):

> Beyond making it easy to host and collaborate on public and private repositories, GitLab also simplifies the rest of the process by offering the whole delivery toolchain, built in. And now, it's not only built in, it's automated. Simply commit your code and Auto DevOps can do the rest. Auto DevOps is a pre-built, fully featured CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire delivery process.  

Read more in the 11.0 release blog post: [GitLab 11.0 released with Auto DevOps and License Management](/releases/2018/06/22/gitlab-11-0-released/).

### 10.0 Launch

The theme of our 10.0 launch was [Auto DevOps](/auto-devops):

> From the formulation of an idea to executing and monitoring it in production, DevOps establishes a culture and environment where developing, testing, and releasing software can happen quickly, frequently, and more reliably.
>
> GitLab 10.0 delivers a hands-free DevOps environment with the introduction of Auto DevOps, allowing your team to easily configure and adopt modern development practices in your workflow.

## Planned updates

Product Marketing delivers quarterly product release update Sales enablement sessions. These are aligned with the product year, beginning with annual, major releases like 13.0 on May 22, 2020.

Near a major release, Product Marketing also produces a "year in review" and a forward-looking launch of the new version. Monthly release blog posts continue to announce monthly releases with Product Marketing support.

Version 13 enablements include a 13.0–13.2 quarterly for May–July, 13.3–13.5 for August–October, 13.6–13.8 for November–January, and 13.9–13.11 for February–April, leading into a Version 13 Year in Review and 14.0 Launch in May, 2021.

*GitLab's annual, major release moved up by one month before Version 13, leaving Version 12's last release as 12.10 rather than 12.11, to track our product year quarters with those of our fiscal year. We turned the dial on release updates by one notch to match, so as of July, 2020 the Version 13 quarterly enablements also track with the product and fiscal year.*

## Purpose

Product Marketing delivers quarterly and annual, sales-centric updates of:

*  How recent product releases enhance GitLab's value proposition for solving customers' business problems
*  How these releases enhance the value of Premium/Silver and Ultimate/Gold
*  What is coming in the next quarter

Product Marketing Managers also serve as [Messaging Leads for monthly product release blog posts](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#messaging-lead), writing the headline and introduction, identifying key features, and ensuring strong messaging.

This page merges release resources from Product and Marketing with related Sales Enablement pages, videos, and presentations. A "[handbook first](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first)" approach makes resources more findable and usable by Sales or anyone interested, and provides a stronger foundation for learning.
