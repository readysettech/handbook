## Welcome to the Practical Handbook Edits Examples Page

This page contains video recordings and written tips for non-engineering teams and how to be Handbook-First. In these videos, we run through the GitLab Handbook with experts, uncovering how to best use the Handbook in our day-to-day work, and learning best-practices for Handbook editing along the way. This page is intended to be complementary to [Using GitLab at GitLab](/handbook/using-gitlab-at-gitlab/#using-gitlab-competency), and we suggest you start there if you have not yet completed the [GitLab 101 Tool Certification](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/certifications/gitlab-101/).

### More Tips

#### Pre-requisites

Some tips may require terminal shell access on macOS/Linux. Ensure that your environment is working and that you have cloned the [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com) project for example.

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com.git
```

Sync it. Ensure that you stash away local changed not yet committed.

```
cd www-gitlab-com
git stash
git checkout master
git pull
```

On macOS it is advised to use Homebrew and install the GNU tools. See [this blogpost](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/04/17/dotfiles-document-and-automate-your-macbook-setup/) for a macOS setup.

```
brew install gnu-sed
```

#### Find files

One of the shell tools provided with macOS/Linux GNU is `find`. Open a terminal an run the following command in the main directory of the `www-gitlab-com` repository to get a list of all `*.md` files. This matches `.md` as suffix.

```
find . -type f -name '*.md'
```

Instead of the `.` you can also use a directory in the current path.

```
find source/handbook -type f -name '*.md'
```

The type `f` specifies files, `d` matches for directories. When not specified, all files and directories are taken into account.

You can replace `-name` with `-regex` to do more sensitive matching, for example to match all `.md` and `.md.erb` files.

```
find . -type f -regex '.*\.md[.erb]*'
```

This can be useful to **check whether a blog post was merged to master**:

```
git checkout master
git pull
find . -type f -name '*blogpost-filename*'
```


#### Find files and perform an action

This comes in handy when you want to print all matches with a prefix, or perform additional replace actions. The main principle is to follow the matching rules explained above, and add the `-exec` parameter.

The `exec` action should start a shell and execute a command in there. `sh -c '' \;` takes care of this for every file that matches. Imagine this as a loop of sequential steps to perform the action. The last missing bit is accessing the file in the current loop iteration. This is done via the `{}` marker inside the `echo` example printing the output.

Run the command in a terminal to see how it works:

```
find source/handbook/marketing -type f -name '*.md' -exec sh -c 'echo "Matched {}"' \;
```

#### Replace strings in a file

The GNU `sed` shell command is useful to replace a defined string in a file. The `-i` flag specifies to do that inline in the same file. The `g` flag defines a global match, replacing all pattern matches.

```
sed -i 's/<searchtext>/<replacementtext>/g' file.md
```

On macOS, ensure that the `gnu-sed` package is installed, and run `gsed` (instead of `sed`).

```
gsed -i 's/<searchtext>/<replacementtext>/g' file.md
```

With using the `/` separator, it is necessary to escape all `/` characters in the string. You can avoid this by choosing another separator, for example `,`:

```
gsed -i 's,<searchtext>,<replacementtext>,g' file.md
```

#### Find and Replace a String in all (Matching) Files

Sometimes a project, URL target or Slack channel is being renamed. You can easily search and edit with the Web IDE on GitLab.com but for other files there is a quick and automated way required.

This method combines the find, exec and sed tips explained above. The `exec` action is now to use sed to perform an inline replacement of a pattern/string.

The following example is used in [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/49617) for updating the Corporate Marketing project URL in all files.

```
git checkout master
git pull origin master

git checkout -b handbook/corp-mktg-project-url

find source/handbook -type f -exec sh -c 'gsed -i "s,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate-marketing,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing,g" "{}"' \;

git status
git diff

git commit -av -m "Handbook: Update corporate marketing project URL"

git push -u origin handbook/corp-mktg-project-url

<open URL in browser for MR>
```

To cut it down:

- Find and match all files in the `source/handbook` directory. The URL might be found in other files too.
- `exec` runs a `sed/gsed` action
- The replacement is `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate-marketing` with `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing`
- Verify the changes with `git status` and `git diff` before committing them
- Commit, push and create the MR from the URL
