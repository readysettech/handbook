## Welcome to the Product Team Handbook

- Most of the content in the product handbook talks about _how_ we do product at GitLab.
- To learn more about _what_ we are currently building and our product direction see [Product Direction](/direction).
- Are you looking to talk to a Product Manager or collaborate with the Team see our [How to Engage](/handbook/product/how-to-engage) guide.

### Product Team Mission

**As a Product Org we strive to consistently create products and experiences that customers love and value.**

- **Consistency wins as you scale**. Our organizational goal is to create a Product Manager (PM) system that maximizes the chances of success across new products, new features, and new team members.
- **We are shipping an experience**, and not just a product. Donâ€™t forget about the links between the product and the website, pricing & packaging, documentation, sales, support, etc.
- **Itâ€™s about our customers and doing a job for them**, not the product itself. Think externally about customer problems, not internally about the technology.
- **Itâ€™s about love AND value**. Will customers value what we are building? We need to make sure what we build helps build and extract customer value.

#### Changing the Product Handbook Content

This is the Product handbook. If you see any typos, copywriting improvements or small content clarifications you'd like to contribute, please create a merge request and merge it yourself (provided you have merge permissions to this repository). And please mention [Product Operations](/company/team/#fseifoddini) in the merge request as a heads up and so we can thank you! Since we have a [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action), we trust your judgement.

If you have a larger change such as wanting to add new sections or significantly modify content in an existing section, please create a merge request and direct ping [Product Operations DRI](/company/team/#fseifoddini) to simply inform, request review or seek collaboration. If you have a larger change such as wanting to add/modify content to the product handbook landing page or adding entirely new pages (or don't have merge permissions), please create a merge request and direct ping [Product Operations DRI](/company/team/#fseifoddini) for review, collaboration and approval.

Please note it is your responsibility to inform GitLabbers as needed about your merge request, so we can all stay aligned and informed. Depending on the scope of changes, consider the following these best practices to inform product managers and other cross-functional team members:

- If specifically relevant to product management, tag '@gl-product' in the MR prior to merging
- If relevant to other teams, tag department leads such as the VP of UX, VP of Development or the Director of Quality Engineering in the MR prior to merging
- Share and cross post the MR link with a brief description in relevant channels such as Slack #product, #product-leadership, #eng-managers, #ux-managers
- Add as a read-only or discussion topic as appropriate in the the  [Weekly Product Management Meeting](/handbook/product/product-processes/#weekly-product-management-meeting)
- If you need more guidance on how/where/when to share, check out more [tips and best practices](/handbook/communication/#top-tips-and-best-practices) in [GitLab Communication](/handbook/communication/)

##### Required Knowledge for Product Managers

<kbd class="required">Required ðŸ”Ž</kbd>

The Product handbook contains a lot of content that includes a mix of advice, best-practices,
mandatory process, team-specific content, and more. To help you find the most important
items, look for the badge above that indicate the most essential, important, and/or
obligatory processes that every Product Manager is expected to know by heart and follow,
as opposed to other items which may be more for reference in certain situations or may
be more optional than required. If you are adding or updating an essential handbook section,
consider adding this badge there.
