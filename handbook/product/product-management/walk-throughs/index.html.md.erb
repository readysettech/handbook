### Product Walk Throughs

GitLab has [many product teams working on specific categories](/handbook/product/categories). One way to ensure this growth in teams does not result in a disjointed experience for our users is to consistently perform Product [walk-throughs](/handbook/product/product-processes/#communication#walk-through) that span categories and stages. Product leaders schedule, at a minimum monthly, Product walk-throughs.
