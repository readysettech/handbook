## Product Leadership

The separate page [Product Leadership](/handbook/product/product-leadership/) covers how to be an effective leader in the product management organization.

## Product Organizational Structure

The GitLab Product team includes team members at various levels of [Product Management job titles](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/#product-management-career-development-framework) across our [organizational levels](/company/team/structure/#levels) with scope at various points in our [product hierarchy](/handbook/product/product-categories/#hierarchy). As a result there can be instances where peers across layers don't have the same title. We will always abide by [GitLab's layer structure](/company/team/structure/#layers).

## How to work as a PM

If you follow the [Product Principles](/handbook/product/product-principles) and [Product Processes](/handbook/product/product-processes) in our handbook, you won't be writing long, detailed
specs for a part of the product for next year. So how should you be spending your time?

Invest the majority of your time (say 70%) in deeply understanding the problem.
Then spend 10% of your time writing the spec _for the first iteration only_ and
handling comments, and use the remaining 20% to work on promoting it.

A problem you understand well should always have a (seemingly) simple or obvious
solution. Reduce it to its simplest form and only ship that as an [MVC](/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc).

Once you've shipped your solution, both you and the community will
have a much better idea of what can be improved and what should be prioritized
for future iterations.

As a PM, you're the person that has to kick-off new initiatives. You're not
responsible for shipping something on time, but you _are_ responsible for taking
action and setting the direction. Be active everywhere, over-communicate, and
sell the things you think are important to the rest of the team and community.

As a PM, you need to set the bar for engineering. That is, to push engineering and
the rest of the company. You almost want engineering to complain about the pace
that product is setting. Our default instinct will be to slow down, but we can't
give in to that.

As a PM you don't own the product; ask other people for feedback and give
team members and the community the space to suggest and create things without your
direct intervention. It's your job to make sure things are decided and
planned, not come up with every idea or change.

### Where should you look when you need help?

- The first thing you should do is read this page carefully, as well as the
[general handbook](/handbook/).
- You can ask questions related to Product in the `#product` Slack channel.
- General questions should be asked in `#questions`.
- Specific Git related questions should be asked in `#git-help`.
- HR questions should be asked in `#peopleops`.

### Responsibilities and Expectations

The responsibilities for [Product Managers, Sr. Product Managers, and Principal Product Managers](/job-families/product/product-manager/), [Group Manager, Product Management](/job-families/product/group-manager-product/)
[Director of Product](/job-families/product/director-of-product/),
[VP of Product](/job-families/product/vp-of-product/) and
[VP of Product Strategy](/job-families/product/vp-of-product-strategy/) are outlined in our job families pages.

The progression of responsibilities allocation between tactical, operational and strategic
is well illustrated by this helpful chart.

![GitLab PM Responsibility Allocation Chart](/handbook/product/pm-allocation.png)

_[Source File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19gAgPJVdXfBpXiFOlT1WqZLJB_eFU7W7slmAzodEuDM/edit#gid=1012729771). Note - Thanks to [Melissa Perri](https://twitter.com/lissijean/) for the inspiration_

In addition, as a Product Manager you're expected to:

- Use the product and deeply understand the features you're responsible for.
- Follow the issues you've been involved with / are assigned to as a PM. That
includes reading all comments. Use email notifications for this.
- Make sure the issue description and title is updated when necessary. It
should always reflect the current state of the issue.
- Make sure issues are moved forward when needed. You should not only avoid
being the bottleneck, you should also be the person moving issues forward when
they get stuck or overlooked.
- Make sure features solve the original problem effectively.
- Make sure features are complete: documentation, marketing, API, etc.
- Know when to cut corners and when not to. If we merge documentation a day
later, that's usually acceptable. Conversely though, learning from a customer
that documentation is lacking is not.
- Excite and market new features and changes internally and externally.
- Help build a plan and strategy for GitLab and GitLab's features.
- Understand deeply whatever it is you're working on. You should be spending a
lot of time learning about your subject matter.
- Have regular meetings (at least once a week) with customers.
- Make sure marketing materials related to your work are up to date.
- Ensure that `data/categories.yml` is up to date, including accurate links based on the defined link [hierarchy](/handbook/product/product-categories/).

Occasionally, Product Managers are asked to perform the role of "Life Support" Product Manager for
a group. When doing so please refer to the [Life Support PM expectations](#life-support-pm-expectations).

As we grow, Product Managers can be listed across multiple stages and be asked to
perform the role of Product Manager across split or multiple teams in an "Interim" basis. While
temporary and based on future hiring, these positions are not considered
"Life Support" and thus the standard Responsibilities and Expectations apply.

### Scope of responsibilities

The product team is responsible for iteration on most of GitLab's products and
projects:

- GitLab CE and EE
- GitLab.com
- about.gitlab.com
- customers.gitlab.com
- version.gitlab.com
- license.gitlab.com

This includes the entire stack and all its facets. The product team needs to
weigh and prioritize not only bugs, features, regressions, performance, but also
architectural changes and other aspects required for ensuring GitLab's excellence

#### Cost profile and user experience

Every Product Manager is responsible for the user experience and cost profile of their product area regardless of how the application is hosted (self-managed or gitlab.com). If a feature is unsustainable from a cost standpoint, that can erode the margins of our SaaS business while driving up the total cost of ownership for self-managed customers. If a feature is slow, it can impact the satisfaction of our users and potentially others on the platform.

There are a few questions a Product Manager should ask when thinking about their features:

* What are the costs associated with my product area? What is the impact on the margin for each tier of GitLab.com?
  * Consider network, compute, and storage costs
* Are there tools in place to help GitLab, Inc and self-managed admins optimize the cost footprint for running GitLab (e.g. node rebalancing, transitioning objects to less costly storage classes, garbage collection capabilities)
* Are there features and default settings that help users stay within their [CI and Storage limits](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)?
* Are there configurable [application limits](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#introducing-application-limits) in place for admins to enhance the availability and performance of GitLab and reduce [abuse vectors](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/operations/abuse/#examples-of-common-forms-of-abuse-include-but-are-not-limited-to)?
* What is the experience of users when interacting with these features on GitLab.com? Is it fast and enjoyable?

These items do not all need to be implemented in an MVC, though potential costs and application limits should be considered for deployment on GitLab.com. 

Product Managers should also regularly assess the performance and cost of features and experiences that they are incrementally improving. While the MVC of the feature may be efficient, a few iterations may increase the cost profile.

##### Tools to understand operational costs

There are a few different tools PM's can utilize to understand the operational costs of their features. Some of these are maintained by Infrastructure, based on the operational data of GitLab.com. Others tools, like usage ping, can be utilized to better understand the costs of our self-managed users. Ultimately, each product group is responsible for ensuring they have the data needed to understand and optimize costs.

* [GCP Billing Data](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/) ([Access Request](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/) required)
* [Storage cost baseline sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ueiYa_FHC_fcK97Mzv7jHEDNf8NHU0fWa4i_3HVO2v4/edit#gid=0)
* [Usage ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/telemetry/usage_ping.html)
* Your Engineering Manager, #infrafin on Slack, and the broader GitLab team

##### Tools to understand end user experience

* [Snowplow data](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/platform/snowplow/) on GitLab.com
* Quarterly NPS and SUS surveys
* [Page load performance](../product-processes/#page-load-performance-metrics)

### Direction

Our product wide, section, stage and category direction pages can be found from our [Direction](/direction) page.

As this document and the [direction page](/direction) shows,
there are a million things we want to do.
So, how do we prioritize them and schedule things properly?
A [product group](/company/team/structure/#product-groups)'s [PM is the DRI for prioritization](#pm-em-ux-and-qe-quad-dris) and per our DRI definition they do not [owe an explanation for their decisions](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#empowering-dris-no-explanation-needed) because we don't want PMs to fall into a perpetual loop of explaining and prefer a [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action). However, [one responsibility of a PM](/job-families/product/product-manager/#responsibilities) is to build rapport and align your stakeholders on priorities. It's almost always in a PMs best interest to explain why they are making prioritization calls.

### CDF Reviews

Product Management Leadership will perform CDF reviews with their team members on a regular cadence; the minimum frequency is every 2 months. Consider creating a recurring meeting dedicated to this topic rather than utilizing existing 1:1 meetings.

#### What is the expected outcome of a CDF Review?
CDF reviews should result in actionable improvement focus areas for the product manager. When conducting a CDF review, managers should consider drilling into specific items within the PM's purview to highlight where the reviewee can focus on improving. PM [competencies](#competencies) are also valuable for identifying improvement areas.

#### Topics for Discussion in CDF Reviews by Track
**Validation Track Skills**
* Partnership with design
* Opportunity canvas
* Sensing mechanisms
* Self learning
* Persona understanding
* Using feedback from PI
* Discovery iteration

**Build Track Skills**

* Issue crispness
* Development metrics (MR rate)
* Iteration
* Developer stakeholder rapport
* Start with proposals
* Product group cohesion
* Roadmap
* Global optimization

**Business Skills**

* Performance indicators
* Competitive analysis
* Tiered strategy
* Adoption funnel
* Direction updates

#### Compa Ratio Update
After CDF reviews, if warranted, the Product Management Leader will discuss updated [compa group](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#compa-group) ratings with their Manager as part of their next 1:1. This ensures all leaders in the management chain are aware of progress and makes [compensation](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/) and other [performance assessment](/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#talent-assessment-options) updates less surprising and more iterative.

## Competencies

Product Managers must be able to demonstrate a variety of skills across our CDF. We provide additional career development guidance by listing priority [competencies](/handbook/competencies/) for each CDF category.

At the moment we are working building out our Product Management Competencies.

### Validation Track Competencies

The [validation track](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-track) is the first phase of GitLab's Product Development Workflow. Industry wide, this track is commonly referred to as ideation and research. This phase lays the foundation for designs and solutions. When the business and users problems are well understood, the more likely it is that the product will solve the user's problem and the higher likelihood that those users will enjoy the solution.

Using a competencies model will help Product Managers understand the expectations of the validation track at each level in the Product Management organization. The competencies in the validation track are:

1. Customer Interviewing
1. Creating an Opportunity Canvas
1. Creating a Storyboard Designing Prototypes
1. Engaging Analysts via Inquiries

#### Customer Interviewing Competency

Customer interviewing is essential to clearly defining the user's needs, problems, and jobs to be done. At GitLab, customer interviewing is typically done in partnership with User Experience, including Product Design and User Research. This competency will help Product Managers get stronger at problem identification and curating a solid foundation for user stories, prototypes and solutions to be built upon.

### Business Competencies
Product Managers are responsible for driving the success for a product area. Understanding market dynamics along side the ability to organize, influence, and iterate to reach the desired outcomes is essential. 

#### Understanding Buyer Based Tiering
GitLab has an [Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model) business model and generate the majority of revenue from [paid tiers](/pricing/). While general pricing decisions are made by the CEO, [determining pricing tier for product features](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#departments) is an important aspect of the Product Manager's job. We use a [buyer based tiering](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#buyer-based-tiering-clarification) model to determine which of the [four tiers](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#four-tiers) a feature belongs to. Being able to clearly define and articulate pricing decisions and strategy is a critical competency for PMs to master in order to influence the success of GitLab's business.

|  **Level** | **Demonstrates Competency by...**| **Assessment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|**PM**| Are the pricing expert for their respective groups. Comprehends impact of features on pricing and capable of making informed decisions on feature alignment tier with minimal assistance.

Leads group to fulfill GitLab's [stewardship promise](/company/stewardship/#promises). Adept at applying [buyer based tiering](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#buyer-based-open-core) when determining pricing tiers. When necessary, prioritizes [quickly moving features down tiers](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#if-a-feature-can-be-moved-down-do-it-quickly). Aware that placing a feature on a lower tier is not a [two-way-door decision](/handbook/values/#make-two-way-door-decisions) since features cannot move up in tier. Active in learning the buyer personas and common go-to-market motions for relevant categories and stages so that they can prioritize the right features in line with GitLab's [pricing philosophy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#pricing-philosophy). | TBD |
|**Sr. PM**| Skilled at applying buyer based tiering when determining the pricing tier for a feature. Thinks holistically and leverages [capabilities](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#capabilities) to drive adoption for relevant features in paying tiers. Builds logical ramps to enable customers to move up in tier by prioritizing features valued by [advocates and champions](/handbook/sales/sales-operating-procedures/facilitate-the-opportunity/#312-finding-your-champions). Provides guidance and coaching to team members and fellow Product Managers to help drive consistency in tiering strategy. | TBD |
|**Principal PM/ Group Manager PM**| Highly skilled at applying buyer based tiering when determining the pricing tier for a feature. Deeply familiar with the buyer persona and go-to-market motion in relevant stages or categories and can identify and lead their group to find the right balance between [revenue, cost, and value](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#when-is-a-dollar-not-a-dollar) for GitLab and its customers. Supports the [hybrid sales model](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#hybrid-sales-model) by simultaneously building a pipeline of self-service GitLab users with useful features in core and starter and provide higher tier value by building indispensable enterprise features and cross-stage integrations. | TBD |

|**Director PM**| Ensures consistent application of buyer based tiering across product stages. Coaches Product Managers on market-specific buyer needs and go-to-market strategy. Applies [consumption pricing principles](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#consumption-pricing-principles) to help simplify pricing and make GitLab more scalable. Ensures [tiering and pricing changes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature-Tier-Or-Pricing-Change) do not have any preventable negative financial or business model impact. | TBD |


### Communication Competencies

[Product Managers communicate](/handbook/product/product-processes/#communication) to various audiences across an array of medium. As a result the set of communication competencies for Product Managers is more diverse than those for other positions.

#### Writing to Inspire Action Competency

[Writing to inspire action](/handbook/product/product-processes/#writing-to-inspire-action) is a critical competency for PMs in order to facilitate a bias towards action within their [Product Groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups). PMs communicate with a wide variety of audiences one key to inspiring action via your writing is focusing on what your reader values.

### Build Track Competencies
The [build track](/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-track) is the second phase of GitLab's Product Development Workflow. This track is the execution phase for the solutions that were validated and designed during the Validation track.

Using a competencies model will help Product Managers understand the expectations of the build track at each level in the Product Management organization. The competencies in the build track are:

1. Breaking Down Your Issues
1. Optimizing PM Inputs for Development Outputs
1. Understanding GitLab Architecture
1. Demoing GitLab

#### Breaking Down Issues
The ability to break down larger features and functionality into small iterative issues is a key skill of any Product Manager. Breaking down issues into small iterations enables the development team to quickly understand what is the next most important iteration to execute.  To be skilled in this competency, a Product Manager must have a deep understanding of the customer problem to be solved, a strong familiarity with how GitLab is architected, and familiar with how software applications function.

## Contributing to our PM Competencies

Every GitLab team member is encouraged to contribute to the list of prioritized Product Manager competencies, as well as the content for each competency via merge requests to this page.

To contribute, open an issue in the Product project using the [Product Competencies](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Product-Competencies.md) template. The steps in the issue will guide you through getting a future competency merged into this page. 

### Product Manager Onboarding

Product Manager onboarding, beyond any [product specific steps in your first week onboarding ticket](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/employment/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_tasks/department_product_management.md),
is defined in the Product projects [PM Onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/PM-onboarding.md).

Onboarding issues can be tracked in the [Product Onboarding Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/boards/1283554?&label_name%5B%5D=onboarding).

Iteration on Product Management Onboarding is encouraged by all team members. To do so, create an MR against one of the above files and assign it to your manager for review and merge.

## Interviewing Product Management Candidates

A unique and important step in the interview process for Product Management candidates is our Deep Dive Interview. The goal of this interview is to understand the candidate's ability to communicate a long term vision as well as a short term MVC, both verbally during the interview itself, and written via two follow up issues. Once the issues are ready for you to read, it is an opportunity to provide feedback and see how the candidate responds to that feedback.

You can find more information and instructions on the Deep Dive interview [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/hiring-processes/blob/master/Product/DeepDive.md). For information on our hiring process, head over to our [hiring handbook pages](/handbook/hiring/). |

## Taking Time Off

Team members are [strongly recommended to take two weeks of consecutive time off a year](/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off). Extended leave longer than the [`no ask, must tell` GitLab paid time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off) is common, especially for [parental leave](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave). Leaving for a longer period of time can be daunting, but it is critical to ensure your `rest ethic` meets your `work ethic` and also to ensure we don't have single points of failure in the company. Here are a few suggestions for product managers to help plan for this time.

On a high level, these are the two most important things to do:

1. [Communicate your time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off)
1. [Create a PM coverage issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) (details below)

### Creating a PM coverage issue

You can use [this issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) to define handshake responsibilites. For extended leave it is important to find one or more Directly Responsible Individuals (DRIs) that will be able to make product descisions while you are away. This may be your manager, another PM, or maybe the engineering manager for your team. The coverage issue should contain all the necessary information for the DRIs to make good decisions in your absence, so please make sure to include as much detail as needed. In addition to creating the issue, it may be useful to have a specific handover meeting to ensure that everyone is on the same page before you leave.

### Returning from Time Off

Returning from time off can be overwhelming and daunting. You should work with your DRIs to understand what has changed during your absence and what the current priorities are. Also, communicate transparently that your response time may be slower because you are catching up. Here are some additional tips on [how to return back to work after taking parental leave](/handbook/paid-time-off/#returning-to-work-after-parental-leave).
