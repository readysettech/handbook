The Customer Success department is part of the [GitLab Sales](/handbook/sales) function who partners with our large and strategic customers to deliver value throughout their journey with GitLab.

The team can be reached in [Slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/customer-success) (internal only).

## Mission Statement
To deliver value to all customers by engaging in a consistent, repeatable, scalable way across defined segments so that customers see the value in their investment with GitLab, and we retain and drive growth within our enterprise customers.

* The mission of the Customer Success Department is to provide these customers with experience in order to:
    * Accelerate initial customer value
    * Maximize long-term, sustainable customer value
    * Improve overall customer satisfaction & referenceability
    * Maximize the total value of the customer to GitLab

## Vision Page
The ["Customer Success Vision Page"](/handbook/customer-success/vision) provides the long-term view of company wide success to which the customer success will be building in partnership with the value centers of the GitLab organization (i.e., Marketing, Sales, Product/Engineering, Support, Finance and IT).

## Department Initiatives
Our large and strategic customers are in need of an ongoing partnership that combines expert guidance with flexibility and adaptability to support their adoption and continuous improvement initiatives.

These customers expect that partner to provide a streamlined, consistent and fully coordinated experience that encompasses the full span of their needs as well as the fully lifecycle of the relationship.
Need to focus on 4 main areas in order to grow in our existing accounts as well as land large and strategic:

1. Awareness
2. Adoption
3. Usage
4. Performance

### Initiative: Awareness
Opportunity to improve the overall awareness of GitLab in order to promote and evangelize our brand and solution in a meaningful way to provide big business impact to our customers so that they believe in our vision and strategy.

### Initiative: Adoption
Ensuring paying customers are successful in their onboarding in order to gain adoption and get the most out of our platform and remain happy, paying GitLab team-members and brand advocates.

### Initiative: Usage
Collecting and making use of customer data and insights is key to customer success.  Itâ€™s important to do more with data and when necessary share back with customers, which in turn helps and encourages our customers to improve and drive adoption.

### Initiative: Performance
Utilizing built-in monitoring instrumentation and [a scalable HA architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/README.html#reference-architecture), The Customer Success team helps ensure implementations of GitLab are operating at peak performance as organization scale and adopt more features.

## Account Team

The account team is comprised of the Strategic Account Leader/Account Executive, Solutions Architect (Enterprise), and Technical Account Manager.

[More information about the account team](/handbook/customer-success/account-team/)

## Overlap Between Solution Architects and Technical Account Managers

SA owns 1) pre-sales technical evaluation and relationships prior to the initial sale and 2) tier upgrades and new business units (i.e., connected new) within an existing customer.  TAM owns 1) post-sales customer relationship and 2) license upgrades within an existing customer.

TAM engagement prior to the sale should occur in the following situations:

1. At the POV completion & presentation meeting when the results are reviewed and next steps agreed upon
1. A shared customer issue tracking project has been created that will affect the account long-term
1. As requested by the SA if the TAM has a specific subject matter expertise relevant to the conversation

SA's will be brought back in to a customer account in the following situations

1. Development of expansion plans with the SAL and TAM leading to tier upgrades
1. A new POV or product evaluation begins for a single team or an enterprise-wide upgrade
1. Any product license expansion that require overviews, education and competitive insights prior to close
1. Any Professional Services that are being discussed and may require an SOW
1. If a TAM is over-committed or unable to support a customer request, the SA may be requested to assist
1. Support of GitLab days or other on-site evangelism of GitLab at customer sites

### Optimized Account Growth Program

In order to evangelize and grow the use of GitLab in existing accounts, the [Optimized Account Growth Program](/handbook/customer-success/optimized-account-growth-program) has been developed to facilitate collaborative sessions and workshops within customer environments. The program is intended to improve the partnership between GitLab and the customer, solving complex business problems while reducing cycle times and improving workflow, ultimately resulting in the growth in adoption and usage of GitLab in customer environments.

### Dogfooding

Outside of Engineering the Customer Success team has the largest concentration of tooling development capability. The team has unique needs that can't always be solved by GitLab's single DevOps platform. However, it is important to [dogfood](/handbook/values/#dogfooding) and avoid [dogfooding anti-patterns](/handbook/engineering/#dogfooding-antipatterns).  As a result the [Product organization heavily weights internal customers](/handbook/values/#dogfooding) when considering prioritization. If you are considering building tooling in support of Customer Success priorities outside of GitLab, please follow the [dogfooding process](/handbook/values/#dogfooding).

### Customer Success AWS Test Account

In an effort to keep AWS spend down initiatives are being taken automatically clean up our AWS account. This account is primarily used as a proof of concept for IaC and creating demos for GitLab customers. An automated cleanup script is currently being tested that will tag, shutdown and delete old resources as they are no longer needed. The automation will:

* Turn off and Tag Un-named resources. When resources are created a "Name" tag should be created with a value that's meaningful and indicates who deployed the resource. Example: {initials}-GitLabRunner
* New Resources will be automatically tagged with a Discovered and Expiration tag.
* The Expiration tag is 14 days after the discovery. The script will only a tag an instance once. If you need additional time, please change the date to a reasonable date for cleanup (Add a month or two for prospective customers).
* If a resource needs to be permanent please set termination protection on the instance. This should also include tagging the instance with an explanation on why it's permanent and what its for.
* On expiration the resource will be shut off and left for 7 days.
* In 7 days if the instance is still off a snapshot will be taken and it will be terminated.
* If the instance is still on but the expiration has not been changed it will be terminated.

### Customer Success Tools and Scripts

By customer or internal request, we sometimes develop tools to automate certain GitLab tasks using the API. The resulting tools and scripts are publicly available for everyone to use and contribute to in the [GitLab CS Tools group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cs-tools).

###  Frequently Asked Questions

Customer Success team members maintain a [FAQ](/handbook/customer-success/faq) to keep questions customers ask documented in a place where everyone can view and contribute to.
