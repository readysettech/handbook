1. Add the recipient who will be signing the document to the email and Cc yourself
1. Update subject line to “[customer name]- project sign off
1. Send the email
1. Go into the PSE in SalesForce and update the following fields, general notes (to note the sign off has been sent), status to closure, and update percent to 99%

 

```
Dear [signer],

Attached you will find the project sign off documentation for your GitLab Professional Services Statement of Work. 

Please sign the document and return at your earliest convenience.  You may reply all with the word “accepted” and that will be accepted approval as well.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me know.

Thank you,
[your signature]

Once you receive the Project Sign off, via signed document or email acceptance, or passive acceptance, you'll need to mark the SOW/PSE object in Salesforce as complete (see steps below), send survey email with survey link (see steps below), and complete the financial-wrapup workflow.
SalesForce steps:

1. Go to PSE record in Salesforce
1. Enter the Completed Date
1. In the Status field, change to "Completed"
1. Set the percentage complete to 100%
1. Select if signed or passive acceptance
1. Save


Survey steps:

1. Create an email with the subject line Project Survey and address it to the main POC from the project
1. Use the message below for the body of the email
1. Send
