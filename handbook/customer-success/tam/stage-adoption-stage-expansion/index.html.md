## Stage Adoption & Stage Expansion

The TAM team's primary focus is to align with a customer's desired business outcomes, enable the customer in their current use case, and expand the customer's use case into new stages.

**Stage Adoption**
Stage adoption is the usage level of existing features and use cases within a given stage that a customer is using. As part of the TAM engagement, the TAM will work with the customer to provide guidance on adopting stages to maximize value attribution and align adoption to the customer's desired positive business outcomes. As stages include features across multiple subscription tiers, the TAM may drive stage adoption as part of proposing a subscription tier upgrade.**

**Stage Expansion**
Stage expansion is the process of helping a customer adoption a new stage, including the discovery of needs, value positioning, and enablement of the customer to adopt the new stage. The enablement can occur via digital content, TAM motion, and/or paid professional services.
