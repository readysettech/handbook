Customer Onboarding is the [beginning phase of the customer lifecycle](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#lifecycle-stages).

### CTA Creation Criteria

When a customer purchases or upgrades GitLab to an ARR of $50,000 or greater, a [Call To Action (CTA)](/handbook/customer-success/tam/gainsight/ctas) is triggered within Gainsight for new Enterprise (50k+ ARR) and Mid-Market (20k+ ARR) accounts. 

A CTA is created for the TAM Manager if the TAM field is not populated. Once populated, an Onboarding CTA is kicked off for the TAM. The Onboarding CTA creates a Playbook with guided steps for the next several weeks.

### CTA Content and Process

The CTA guides the TAM through the initial customer engagement.  The tasks and associated content are as follows:

1. Complete internal transition with the SAL/AE and SA, covering the Command Plan, adoption goals and priorities and stakeholders
1. Send TAM Welcome Email introducing themselves and the role of the TAM (TAM sends, template in Gainsight)
1. Hold Kick Off Call Using [Kick Off Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RcMrN-TQxQt-tEaX1J2EcJATJQfBunStXGTjhGu8CDA/edit?usp=sharing)
1. Document Customer Attributes in Gainsight
1. Hold 1st Cadence Call Focusing on Future Growth
1. Send Customer Satisfaction Survey & Swag Email (TAM sends, template in Gainsight)

Use the Gainsight TAM Dashboard and the Customer Onboarding Dashboard to manage customers currently in Onboarding.

Please also review our [TAM and Support interaction](/handbook/customer-success/tam/support) page as well as our [Support](/handbook/support) handbook section to assist with sharing support information with customers.

While an Onboarding CTA is an automated process, it can also be created manually by going to the Cockpit, clicking `+ CTA` and then choosing the Onboarding playbook.

### Gainsight C360 Fields

During Onboarding, the TAM should also review the fields in the C360 to create a full picture. Here are a few examples:

1. Fields in the Attributes section
1. TAM Sentiment
1. [Stage Adoption](/handbook/customer-success/tam/stage-adoption/)
1. [Customer Deployment Types](/handbook/customer-success/tam/gainsight/deployment-types/)

### Time to Value Metrics

The [Time to Value KPIs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/vision/#time-to-value-kpis) are developed to help us understand key facts about how we are serving our customers, and how we could improve. Below are the processes for how TAMs should update and track their Time to Value KPIs. For definitions, please see [Time to Value KPIs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/vision/#time-to-value-kpis). For data visualization, see [Customer Onboarding Dashboard](https://gitlab.gainsightcloud.com/v1/ui/home#58502af5-e7c2-4cbd-8645-d612b74424ff).

#### Time to Engage

Time to Engage is calculated by taking the days between Salesforce's `Original Contract Date` and subtracting the date of the first Timeline call or meeting entry. Example: Original Contract Date is 2020-01-01 and the first call was 2020-01-12, then it would be 11 days.
- Required TAM action: log the first Timeline entry (Call or Meeting)

#### Time to First Value

Time to First Value is calculated by taking the `Original Contract Date` and subtracting `First Value Date`, which is a manual input on the customer's Attributes section of the C360.
- Required TAM action: update the `First Value Date`


#### Time to Onboard

Time to Onboard is the difference between `Original Contract Date` and the date the Onboarding CTA is closed. For example, the `Original Contract Date` is 2020-08-15 and the Onboarding CTA was closed on 2020-09-20, the Time to Onboard would be 36 days.
- Required TAM action: Close the Onboarding CTA
