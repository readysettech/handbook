A [CTA](https://support.gainsight.com/Gainsight_NXT/04Cockpit_and_Playbooks/01About/CTAs_Tasks_and_Playbooks_Overview) is a call to action that is tied to a customer and appears in a TAM's cockpit, as well as the account cockpit. CTAs can be created manually at any time, but some will automatically be created for you based on certain events or data.

To create a new CTA, go to your cockpit and click "+ CTA", then fill out the appropriate information. If a CTA will consist of multiple tasks over a period of time, click CTA after saving it, then click the three dots on the top right of the new right sidebar, and click "Add Task". You can add as many as needed and track your progress in the milestone section.

Watch a quick [video on Gainsight CTAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkjmTh3Qad4&feature=youtu.be) to learn how to use them, best practices, and tricks.

* Click the first "Due Date (Due)" button at the top to change the groupings of the CTAs as desired (you can group by Type, Company, Renewal Date, etc.)
* Click the second "Due Date (Due)" button at the top to change the sort order of the CTAs within each group
* Use the filter button at the top right to create and save customized CTA reports, which you can later access in the dropdown

### Types of CTAs

If the CTA you're opening does not fall into one of the playbook categories, choose the type that makes the most sense. If it's a common CTA, suggest creating a playbook for the it by [opening an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/boards/1731118?&label_name[]=gainsight).
