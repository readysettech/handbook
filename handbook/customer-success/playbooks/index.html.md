TAMs create playbooks to provide a prescriptive methodology to help with customer discussions around certain aspects of GitLab. We currently have a [Stage Adoption Guideline](/handbook/customer-success/tam/stage-adoption/) to assist with understanding where a customer stands, and we are working on merging adoption maps into the use case pages.
