## Paid Time Off (PTO) ðŸŒ´

ReadySet is a fast-paced company, and time away from work can be extremely helpful for maintaining a healthy work/life balance. 
We offer any full-time employee **unlimited paid time off (PTO)** **in addition to holidays they choose to observe** (bank, federal, religious, or otherwise). 
We encourage you to take full advantage of PTO! It is important to recharge your batteries so you can come back to work refreshed.

Please try to communicate early and broadly when you will be away so that other team members can manage time efficiently, 
projects don't slip through the cracks, and so that you don't get bothered while away. 
We ask that you add your days off as "Your_Name OOO" to the **[ReadySet Vacations and Holidays GCal](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y184Y3U0ZmdtZDQxa3Rnc3EycmM2aDdiZnZtc0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)** 
(which has been pre-populated with National Holidays) and make a post to the **#time-off slack channel** as soon as you have made your plans.

You do not need to worry about taking time off, posting to the slack, or adding to GCal for things like going grocery shopping, 
doing household chores, helping someone, taking care of a loved one...etc. 
If you have urgent tasks at work, but something comes up or takes longer than expected, just ensure the rest of the team knows and someone can pick up the tasks. 

If you would like to take individual days off ad hoc, 
you donâ€™t need to provide prior notice aside from posting to the slack and adding to the GCal as soon as you know. 
Due to our small team size, we ask for as early notice as possible if you plan to take longer periods of time off. 
We would prefer at least 2 weeks' notice if you are taking 1+ consecutive week(s) off.


## Minimum Vacation Recommendation

We highly recommend that you take a **minimum** of 3 weeks, or 15 workdays, off per year. 
There is no maximum vacation recommendation, 
though there may be more conversations for unique situations in which a team member might want to take longer consecutive periods off (e.g. 6-8 weeks).

We are privileged to be a global team, 
and we ask team members to take time off that is in line with their country's standards even if that's more than our minimum recommendation.


## Parental Leave Policy

ReadySet offers 90 consecutive days, or 3 months, of paid parental leave to full-time employees who have been at ReadySet for at least 6 months, 
regardless of gender. This parental leave applies to each birth or adoption event, 
and can be taken anytime in the first year of having a child. 
For many reasons, more time off may be required, and any employee should talk to their manager if they would like more time.

If you plan to have a child and would like to take parental leave, 
we ask that you please give your manager as much notice as possible so they have ample time to work with your team to arrange out of office coverage.
