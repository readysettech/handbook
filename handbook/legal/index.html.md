We are glad you are here! Meet our [team](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/?department=legal)

Please check out this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh_pPeJkF2o) on the best way to reach Legal, if you ever have any questions you can always reach out on Slack.

## Contacting the Legal Team with General Legal Questions

### 1. Quick Questions

You can reach out to the Legal Team on the *[`#legal`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/legal)* Slack chat channel.  The legal Slack chat channel is reserved for everyday legal questions that can be answered in informal communication. It is not for requests that require legal advice, deliverables, discussion of confidential information.

**Please do not share confidential information on Slack that is not meant for the entire company to see, and do not use it to seek legal advice.**

For more information on Attorney-Client Privilege, see the [General Topics and FAQs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/#general-topics-and-faqs) below. 

### 3. Vendor, Partner, and other "To Pay" Contracts
* If you are looking for a new vendor, need an NDA for a vendor or partner, or need review of a vendor or partner contract, these services are handled by the Procurement Team. For purposes of this process, anyone that will receive payment from GitLab is considered a vendor. 
* Legal will be brought in by Procurement for escalations only. Please see the [Procurement Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/) for more information on the Vendor Management Process. Once a Vendor NDA and/or Contract has been completed, it should be uploaded by the requestor into our contract management database tool [ContractWorks](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/vendor-contract-filing-process/). If you need a license, you will need to submit an Access Request.

# General Topics and FAQs

## 1. The Attorney-Client Relationship in the United States

This discussion is limited to U.S. practices because currently our team members only communicate with U.S. practicing attorneys.  As we continue to grow globally we will update this and expand how privilege applies in other jurisdictions.

### What is the Attorney-Client Privilege?

Attorney-Client Privilege is a law that has been adopted in each of the states of the U.S in some form.  Generally, the law protects communications between clients and their attorneys for the purpose of seeking legal guidance and advice.  The information is not protected if it is available from another source.  Therefore, information cannot be placed under the protections of Attorney-Client privilege simply by telling your attorney or copying your attorney on a communication.  In addition, the underlying facts are also not protected, only the opinions and analysis of the facts, and discussions thereof, with the attorney.  The privilege belongs to the client, and therefore, can only be waived by the client.

### What is Work Product?

Work Product is a U.S. doctrine in which an attorney’s notes, observations, thoughts, and research prepared by, or at the direction of an attorney, in anticipation of litigation, are protected from being discoverable during the litigation process.

### What is the purpose of these Privileges?

The purpose of the Attorney-Client and Work Product privileges is to allow clients to speak freely with their attorneys and encourage full disclosure so they can receive accurate and competent legal advice without the fear of having their attorney compelled to testify against them and disclose the information shared by the client.

### Who do these Privileges Apply to at GitLab?

There is not one uniform answer that covers all jurisdictions in the U.S. 

A minority number of states apply the **Corporate Group Test**. This test is quite restrictive and only allows for the protection of corporate communications to the corporation's controlling executives and managers.

A more commonly used test is the **Subject Matter Test**.  Instead of looking at the roles of the employees involved, this test looks at the subject matter of the employees’ communications. The test will look to see if the employee was instructed to discuss the subject matter with the attorney should be protected and if the subject matter of that communication relates to the performance by the employee of the duties of his or her employment.

A slightly modified version of the **Subject Matter Test** called the **Upjohn Test** is also widely used. Under the **Upjohn Test** the privilege is applied only if the following criteria are satisfied:

* The employee must have made the communication to counsel for the purpose of seeking legal advice regarding the corporation.
* The substance of the communication must involve matters that fall within the scope of the employee's job duties.
* The employee must be aware that the statements are being provided for the purpose of obtaining legal advice for the corporation.
* The communications also must be confidential when made and must be kept confidential by the company.

The Supreme Court case which established the  **Upjohn Test** is also important because it resulted in the **_Upjohn Warning_** which is a procedure in which a company’s attorney explains that he or she does not represent the employee individually, but instead represents the interests of the company.  This is important to note because a company can waive its privilege at any time, meaning the company could choose to disclose information the attorney received from a covered employee in confidence for use as evidence in a legal proceeding in order to protect the company from liability.
 
 The **Subject Matter Test** and **Upjohn Test** are the most commonly used tests. More information about the tests can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rzm_oFo-nGx8RWZgSaZBOCPBL1kCrce3)
 
### How do you Protect the Privileges that Apply to You When Seeking Legal Advice?
 
 * Direct the communication to a practicing licensed attorney.  Privilege does not apply to other non-attorney members of the legal team.
 * It is best practice to have privileged conversations with the attorney via Zoom.
 * If other individuals will need to participate in the discussion, consult with the attorney, and only include the minimum necessary individuals in the conversation, in other words, keep the circle of trust small.
 * If it is necessary to communicate by email, in the “Subject” line, and at the top of the body of the communication, include the phrase **“AC PRIV”**.
 * Do not overuse the claim of privilege. Limit its use to when actually seeking legal guidance and advice and not on any and every correspondence with the attorney.
 * You must keep the information discussed confidential, and not share it with anyone outside the circle of trust without first consulting with the attorney.
 * Do not forward protected emails to anyone outside the circle of trust.
 * Do not copy anyone outside the circle of trust on emails with the attorney.
 * As with anything else, if you ever have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out to the Legal team.

## 2. Litigation Holds

### What is a Litigation Hold?

A litigation hold is the process a company uses to preserve all forms of relevant evidence, whether it be emails, instant messages, physical documents, handwritten or typed notes, voicemails, raw data, backup tapes, and any other type of information that could be relevant to pending or imminent litigation or when litigation is reasonably anticipated.  Litigation holds are imperative in preventing spoliation (destruction, deletion, or alteration) of evidence which can have a severely negative impact on the company's case, including leading to sanctions.

Once the company becomes aware of potential litigation, the company's attorney will provide notice to the impacted employees, instructing them not to delete or destroy any information relating to the subject matter of the litigation.  The litigation hold applies to paper and electronic documents. During a litigation hold, all retention policies must be overridden.

## 3. Human Rights

### How is GitLab advancing Human Rights?

We are committed to upholding fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings around the world should be treated with dignity, fairness, and respect. Our company will only engage suppliers and direct contractors who demonstrate a serious commitment to the health and safety of their workers, and operate in compliance with human rights laws. GitLab does not use or condone the use of slave labor or human trafficking, denounces any degrading treatment of individuals or unsafe working condition, and supports our products being free of conflict minerals.

#### Anti-Slavery and Anti-Human Trafficking Policy

1. Slavery and Human Trafficking are crimes and violations of fundamental human rights. These violations take various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour, and/or human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. GitLab is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in our business dealings and relationships by implementing and enforcing systems/controls to ensure modern slavery or human trafficking are not taking place in our business, or with those with whom we do business.

2. GitLab is also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our business and in our approach to tackling slavery and human trafficking throughout our supply chains and overall organization, consistent with disclosure obligations we may have under applicable law. To that end, we prohibit the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labor, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children by anyone working for or with GitLab.

3. All employees, directors, officers, agents, interns, vendors, distributors, resellers, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners are expected to comply with this policy.

4. Every Team Member is responsible to assist in the prevention, detection and reporting of slavery and human trafficking by those working for or with GitLab.  Each Team Member is encouraged to raise concerns about any known or suspected incidents of slavery or human trafficking in any parts of our business or supply chains at the earliest possible stage.   If you are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their working conditions within any tier of our supply chains or business partners constitutes any of the various forms of modern slavery/human trafficking, raise it at Compliance@Gitlab.com.

5. We may terminate our relationship with individuals and/or Business Partners if they breach this policy.
