### Employee Privacy Policy

This Employee Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains what types of personal information we may collect about our employees and how it may be used.

While this Privacy Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our information processing activities globally, those processing activities may be more limited in some jurisdictions based on the restrictions of their laws. For example, the laws of a country may limit the types of personal information we can collect or the manner in which we process that information. In those instances, we adjust our internal policies and practices to reflect the requirements of local law.

For personal data collected under this Privacy Policy, the controller will be GitLab and the GitLab affiliates by which you are employed. For specific security concerns around your data, please contact your Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) by emailing [dpo@gitlab.com](mailto:dpo@gitlab.com) or your Privacy Officer by emailing [compliance@gitlab.com](mailto:compliance@gitlab.com).

In the event you feel that you have not received proper attention to your data concern, or if you have any other legal/law enforcement concern - please contact GitLab's Legal Department at Legal@gitlab.com.

GitLab, Inc. is a global company with its headquarters in the U.S. This means that personal information may be used, processed, and transferred to the United States and other countries or territories and those countries or territories may not offer the same level of data protection as the country where you reside, including the European Economic Area.  However, GitLab will ensure that appropriate or suitable safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and that transfer of your personal information complies with applicable data protection laws. Where required by applicable data protection laws, GitLab has ensured that service providers (including other GitLab affiliates) sign standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission or other supervisory authority with jurisdiction over the relevant GitLab data exporter (which typically will be your employer).

*Who is collecting your personal data (who is the data controller)?*

*Legal Basis for processing*

Where applicable data protection laws require us to process your personal data on the basis of a specific lawful justification, we generally process your personal data under one of the following bases:

Compliance with a legal obligation to which GitLab is subject; Entering into at-will employment (for US only) or performance under an employment contract with GitLab;
For GitLab's legitimate interests being those purposes described in the section above headed "How We Process and Use Your Personal Information";
Your consent where required and a legitimate legal basis under applicable local laws.

We may on occasion process your personal data for the purpose of the legitimate interests of a Third-Party where this is not overridden by your interests.

*Processing of Special Categories of Personal Data*

“Special Categories of Personal Data” includes information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, sex life or sexual orientation, as well as genetic and biometric data.

From time to time you may provide us with information which constitutes Special Categories of Personal Data or information from which Special Categories of Personal Data may be deduced.  In such cases, where required by law, we will obtain your express written consent to our processing of Special Categories of Personal Data.  If separate consent is not required by local law, by providing this information to GitLab, you give your freely given, informed, explicit consent for us to process those Special Categories of Personal Data for the purposes set out in How We Process and Use Your Personal Information section above.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting your Local HR Department or DPO. Where you have withdrawn consent but GitLab retains the personal data we will only continue to process that Special Category Personal Data where necessary for those purposes where we have another appropriate legal basis such as processing necessary to comply with legal obligations related to employment or social security. However, this may mean that we cannot (for example) administer certain benefits or contact your next-of-kin in an emergency or provide support to you above and beyond our legal obligations.  You give your knowledgeable, freely given, express consent to GitLab for GitLab to use, disclose and otherwise process any personal health information about you that is provided to GitLab by any of your personal health information custodians, for the purposes set out in the How We Process and Use Your Personal Information section above.

When using or collaborating with third parties in the operation of our business, including in connection with providing many of the benefits and services we offer our employees (e.g., human resources information systems, financial investment service providers, insurance providers). When we share personal information with third parties we typically require that they only use or disclose such personal information in a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

In such transactions, employee information is generally one of the transferred business assets and we reserve the right to include your personal information as an asset in any such transfer.

**Additional Rights**
You may also have the following additional rights, subject to certain exceptions and limitations as specified in applicable law:

*Data portability*

Where we are relying upon your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party as the legal basis for processing, and that personal information is processed by automatic means, to the extent provided under applicable law, you have the right to receive all such personal information which you have provided to GitLab in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible;

*Right to restriction of processing*

You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where:

 - You contest the accuracy of the personal information until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;
 - Where the processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the information;
 - Where we no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require them for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
 - Where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to whether GitLab has compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.

To the extent required by applicable law, where personal information is subjected to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

*Right to withdraw consent*

Where we are relying upon your consent to process data, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time. You can do this by contacting your local HR Department or DPO.

*Right to object to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds*

Where we are relying upon legitimate interest to process data, then you have the right to object to such processing, and we must stop such processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Normally, where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in your country of residence, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes this regulation.
