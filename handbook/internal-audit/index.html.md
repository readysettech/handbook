# The Mission of Internal Audit

To enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight, while consistently building trust and strengthening the relationship with management, through the delivery of high quality and distinctive internal audit services.

# What is Internal Audit? 

Internal Audit is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve organization’s operations. 

Internal Audit is responsible to assess the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes and to provide insight and recommendations that can enhance these processes, particularly relating to: 

* Effectiveness of operations;
* Reliability of financial management and reporting; and
* Compliance with laws and regulations.

Internal Audit may also involve conducting fraud investigations to identify fraudulent acts and conducting post investigation fraud audits to identify control breakdowns and establish financial loss.

# How Internal Audit Adds Value

* Internal Audit works closely with management to review systems and operations to identify how well risks are managed, whether the right processes are in place, and whether agreed procedures are being followed. This provides an indication of the integrity of the organization’s systems and processes, their capability to support the set goals and also helps identify areas for improvements. 

* Internal Audit works across all areas of an organization, review tangible (e.g. supply chain/ IT systems) and intangible (e.g. organization culture and ethics) aspects of operations. 

* Internal Audit looks beyond financial statements and financial risks, and consider wider issues, e.g. the organization’s reputation, growth, impact on the environment, and how employees are treated. Any process that has an impact on the effective operation of an organization may be included in internal audit’s scope.

Internal Audit reports administratively to the Principal Accounting Officer but has direct responsibility and reporting to the Board of Directors through an Audit Committee. 

# Internal Audit Activity Charter (effective 2019-06-07)

 [Model Internal Audit Activity Charter](https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/Public%20Documents/Model%20Internal%20Audit%20Activity%20Charter.pdf) by the [Institute of Internal Auditors](https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/topics/pages/the-internal-audit-function.aspx)

**Introduction**

Internal Audit is an independent and objective assurance and consulting activity that is guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the control environment around Gitlab’s financial reporting and to recommend operational efficiencies of GitLab as requested. It assists in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the organization's governance, risk management and internal controls.

**Role**

Currently, the internal audit activity is established by the finance team reporting to the Pricipal Accounting Officer , with dotted line control and input from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Internal Audit has direct access to and oversight from the Audit Committee in its charter. The internal audit activity’s responsibilities will be defined by the Audit Committee as part of its oversight role.

**Professionalism**

The internal audit activity will govern itself by adherence to The Institute of Internal Auditors' mandatory guidance including the Definition of [Internal Auditing](https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/mandatory-guidance/Pages/Definition-of-Internal-Auditing.aspx), the [Code of Ethics](https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/mandatory-guidance/Pages/Code-of-Ethics.aspx), and the [International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing](https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/mandatory-guidance/Pages/Standards.aspx). This mandatory guidance constitutes principles of the fundamental requirements for the professional practice of internal auditing and for evaluating the effectiveness of the internal audit activity’s performance. The Institute of Internal Auditors' [Practice Advisories](https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/recommended-guidance/Pages/Practice-Advisories.aspx), [Practice Guides](https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/recommended-guidance/practice-guides/Pages/Practice-Guides.aspx), and [Position Papers](https://global.theiia.org/about/about-internal-auditing/Pages/Position-Papers.aspx) will also be adhered to as applicable to guide operations. In addition, the internal audit activity will adhere to GitLab relevant policies and procedures and the internal audit activity's standard operating procedures manual.

**Authority**

The internal audit activity, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding records and information, is authorized full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all of GitLab records, physical properties, and personnel pertinent to carrying out any engagement. All employees are requested to assist the internal audit activity in fulfilling its roles and responsibilities.

The internal audit plan will be developed based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based methodology, including input of executive management and the Audit Committee. The Senior Internal Audit Manager will review and adjust the plan, as necessary, in response to changes in the organization’s business, risks, operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any significant deviation from the approved internal audit plan will be communicated to executive management and the Audit Committee through periodic activity reports.

**Reporting and Monitoring**

A written report will be prepared and issued by the Senior Internal Audit Manager or designee following the conclusion of each internal audit engagement and will be distributed as appropriate. Internal audit results will also be communicated to the Audit Committee.

The internal audit report will include management’s response and corrective action taken or to be taken in regard to the specific findings and recommendations. Management's response, whether included within the original audit report or provided thereafter (i.e. within thirty days) by the management of the audited area should include a timetable for anticipated completion of action to be taken and an explanation for any corrective action that will not be implemented.

The internal audit activity will be responsible for appropriate follow-up on engagement findings and recommendations. All significant findings will remain in an open issues file until cleared.

The Senior Internal Audit Manager will periodically report to executive management and the Audit Committee on the internal audit activity’s purpose, authority, and responsibility, as well as performance relative to its plan. Reporting will also include significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters needed or requested by senior management and the Audit Committee.

The internal audit activity will maintain a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of the internal audit activity. The program will include an evaluation of the internal audit activity’s conformance with the Definition of [Internal Auditing](https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/mandatory-guidance/Pages/Definition-of-Internal-Auditing.aspx) and the [Standards](https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/mandatory-guidance/Pages/Standards.aspx) and an evaluation of whether internal auditors apply the [Code of Ethics](https://global.theiia.org/standards-guidance/mandatory-guidance/Pages/Code-of-Ethics.aspx). The program also assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal audit activity and identifies opportunities for improvement.

The Senior Internal Audit Manager will communicate to management and Audit Committee on the internal audit activity’s quality assurance and improvement program, including results of ongoing internal assessments and external assessments conducted at least every five years.


# Internal Audit Performance Measures

To build and continually improve an effective internal audit function, GitLab establishes, the following key objectives for conducting internal audits, the outcome measures associated with each objective, and the activity measures that drive each outcome measure. A link connects each outcome measure with its corresponding formula and analysis of the formula.

***Position Internal Audit as a change agent to improve controls**  
1.	Percentage of Desktop procedures documented = Number of Desktop procedures completed / Number of desktop procedures required to be documented 
1.	Percentage of controls tested = Number of controls tested / Total number of controls
1.	Percentage of recommendations implemented = number of recommendations implemented / total recommendations x 100
1.	Percentage of audits completed = Number of audits completed/ Total number of audits


# Performance Measures for Accounting and Finance Function Related to Audit

1. *Number of material audit adjustments*: The quarterly number of corrections to the financial statements made by suggestion of GitLab’s external auditors. 
2. *Percentage of ineffective SOX Controls* : Percentage of controls that fail test of design and operating effectiveness. Percentage of ineffective SOX Controls = (number of ineffective controls / total controls) x 100
