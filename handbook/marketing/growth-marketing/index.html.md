## Teams
Growth Marketing is comprised of these Marketing Teams. Visit their handbooks to learn more. 
* [Global Content](/handbook/marketing/growth-marketing/content/#what-does-the-global-content-team-do)
* [Brand and Digital Design](/handbook/marketing/growth-marketing/brand-and-digital-design/) 
* [Inbound Marketing](/handbook/marketing/growth-marketing/inbound-marketing/)

## Stable Counterparts
Growth Marketing works across teams and one way we stay efficient is by identifying and working with stable counterparts across GitLab. Identifying [stable counterparts](/blog/2018/10/16/an-ode-to-stable-counterparts/) help us know where to turn when we work on specific processes and share knowledge from our team.

### Current Stable Counterparts
* Shane Rice <> Dara Warde (Marketing Ops)
* Danielle Morrill <> Hila Qu (Product Growth)
* Michael Preuss <> Jean du Plessis (Static Site Editor)

## The Marketing Website

Everyone can [contribute the GitLab Marketing website](/handbook/git-page-update/). 

To make Marketing as inclusive as possible to all contributors, including those who have never written an MR (Merge Request) before, we also provide Marketing support across GitLab in the following ways:

## Communication

### Meeting Cadence

Most of our team meetings are recorded, and can be viewed on GitLab Unfiltered in the [Growth Marketing playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kp0T5rN49dxNeJ5uuJ73wMl).

* Monday team leads kickoff to review priorities and blockers
* Friday full team results recap & demo day to share completed work

### The Handbook 
Is our single source of truth (SSoT) for processes and relevant links

*  All processes at the Growth Marketing team level will be put in the Growth Marketing Overarching Handbook. Individual team should link back to these SSoT sections to avoid confusion. 
*  Individual teams within Growth Marketing will create their handbook sections for specifics to their teams
*  The handbook will be iterated on as we establish and test processes

### When you submit an issue 
You can expect these communications/notifications (either through GitLab or in a comment)

*  You will be provided with specific templates to help you input relevant information
*  Those issues will be vetted at the beginning of each week. The issue will either be: 
   *  Moved into `mktg-status::WIP` or;
   *  A comment will be added for what additional information is needed
*  The issues moved to `mktg-status::WIP` are then put into a sprint and assigned to a week sprint based on priorities, resources, weights and assignment loads
*  The `Assignee` will comment that they have received your Issue and when you can expect more information (ex: "On it. Will respond within the week on timeline")
*  If needed, the Issue Brief will be broken into a Project Epic with relevant issues and those issues re-assigned to the relevant DRIs as `Assignee(s)` 
*  A timeline  will be provided in that Project Epic or individual issue and the due date will be adjusted accordingly.
*  When feedback is needed the `Assignee(s)` will comment in the issue(s) asking for your input. They will be as specific as possible with what they are looking for comments on. 
*  Final deliverables will be added in the appropriate form (file, link to repository, web link, etc.) and the Assignee(s) will @ you
*  When final deliverables have been completed the `Assignee(s)` will close the issue. If additional items are needed please open a new issue and relate to each other.  
*  If an issue needs to be moved to the next milestone the `Assignee` will comment in the issue with the reason (ex: problems with testing)

# How we use GitLab 

## Boards
Overarching Marketing Growth Boards

#### [Triage Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1761578?&label_name[]=mktg-growth&label_name[]=mktg-status%3A%3Atriage) 

*  **GOAL:** Weed out issues that superfluous or don’t contain extra information 
*  **ACTIONS:** Move to either
   *  Move to either `mktg-status:WIP` which puts into the Sprint cycle or;
   *  [mktg-status: blocked] and comment why it is being blocked

#### [Sprint Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1761580?label_name[]=mktg-growth&label_name[]=mktg-status%3A%3Awip)
*  **GOAL:** Assign issues to milestones to be worked on then based on due dates, weights, priorities, resources
*  **ACTIONS:** 
   *  Move to a specific week taking into consideration the above 
   *  Backlog if:
      *  It doesn’t fit into current goals or priorities
      *  We don't have the time or resources currently
      *  It is just a cool idea (some of these may be labeled for future review for upcoming strategies & tactics) 
   *  Comment why it is backlogged
   *  Never backlog PR issues without prior discussion

   > HANDOFF: This is where the handoff to Growth Marketing Teams takes place to run their processes

#### [Growth Marketing Leads Overview](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1787553?milestone_title=%23started&&label_name[]=mktg-growth&label_name[]=mktg-status%3A%3Awip)

## Epics
This is how we use Epics to organize our projects. We aim to include the highest level information at the top level and specific information in lower-level epics. This is to 
keep a SSoT and avoid duplicative placement of information that would need to be updated in multiple places

  * Links to the yearly strategy that contains themes
* **Second Tier Epic**
  * Stores the team or channel strategy/improvements broken into phases
  * Includes
    * Current state
    * Stakeholders
    * Metrics - Baseline and Target
    * Desired state - Key audience + Intent and Key company goals
    * Improvement Roadmap - broken out by quarter if it will cross multiple
    * Phases - per quarter and includes: 
      *   The Problem
      *   The Solution 
      *  Why this Effort
* **Third Tier Epics**
  * Epic per phase - one epic per phase
  * Contains:
   * Scope of project
   * Roles & Responsbilities Chart if different than the parent epic
   * Relevant Documents
   * High-level epic production only - All production for individual issues should be placed in those issues to avoid redundancy 
* **Fourth Tier Epics**
  * MVCs for project - one epic per MVC  
  * Contains: 
    * Scope of MVC
    * Relevant Documents
    * High-level epic production only - All production for individual issues should be placed in those issues to avoid redundanc

## Issues 

### Issue Types
This is how we work with Issues and their scope
#### External
(outside of Growth Marketing)
**REQUEST ONLY ISSUE**
*  This is for complicated projects (example: campaign). 
*  This type of Issue is submitted by a team OUTSIDE of Growth Marketing. 
*  This serves as a brief to us. 
*  For each type of request we have a corresponding  **Request [Type] Issue Template** that should be filled out to begin the process. 
     * [Requesting Support](/handbook/marketing/growth-marketing/#requesting-support)
* Actions taken on issue: 
  * Reviewed for all information and label changed to `mktg-status::WIP` if all there or `mktg-status::blocked` if not all info is there
  * Assigned to a team member to execute on
  * Assigned to a Sprint week to be worked on (worked on= broken down into Production Issues)
  * Issue is added to a child Epic and execution issues are made for creating
  * Assignee will comment and close the Request Issue and deliver the work in the Child Epic

**REQUEST AND PRODUCTION ISSUE**
* This is for a simple ask (example: single asset)
* This type of Issue is submitted by a team outside of Growth Marketing and will contain relevant information for the project AND;
* Execution Items/Production Checklists for the Growth Marketing Teams.
* For each type of request we have a corresponding **Request [Type] Issue Template** that should be filled out to begin the process. 
* Actions taken on issue: 
  * Reviewed for all information and label changed to `mktg-status::WIP` if all there or `mktg-status::blocked` if not all info is there
  * Assigned to a team member to execute on
  * Assigned to a Sprint week to be worked on (worked on = deliverables created)
  * Assignee will follow the production checklist and deliver work within the original Issue

#### Internal
(inside of Growth Marketing)

**PRODUCTION ISSUE**
 * This is an Issue we use internally to create and execute on the request/brief. 
 * These are only used by people inside of Growth Marketing 
 * For each type of request we have a corresponding  **Production [Type] Issue Template** that should be filled out to begin the process. 
 * The teams will deliver the individual pieces to these Issues, but not the completed ask. That should be delivered into the Child Epic created


## Issue Templates
