## Goals

### Demand Generation Key Metrics

- **North Star Metric:** Outbound MQLs
- **Efficiency Metric:** Cost per MQL
- **Business Impact Metric:** CWA/Spend (closed-won attribution)
- **Supporting/Activity Metrics:** SAOs, Attributed Pipeline, Emails Sent

### MQL Targets

| Fiscal Quarter | Large | Mid-Market | SMB |
| -------------- | ----- | ---------- | --- |
| Q3FY21 | 4,708 | 4,500 | 26,893 |
| Q4FY21 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Q1FY22 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Q2FY22 | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Currently WIP to break down geo-specific MQL targets.
_Targets are derived from [Approved Second Half FY21-22 Segment Marketing Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4EmaoSb35d8ZnjKags1gUGF5T9afJW6RhBO8TR_VgA/edit#slide=id.p4) (GitLab internal team members may view this information)._

### Q3 OKRs
**OKRs = Objective + Key Result**
* **Objective:** Meet/Exceed outbound Marketing Qualified Leads ([MQL]((/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#lead-scoring-lead-lifecycle-and-mql-criteria))) generation targets
* **Key Results:**
  * TBD

[See Epic >](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1309)

### FY21-22 First Principles

1. **Find new accounts** to add to the target pool (paid demand gen)
1. **Offer compelling ungated content journeys** that drive to proven web CTAs
1. **Appropriately nurture our database** (of inbound inquiries, free .com users, core users, customers)

## Team Structure

The Campaigns Team is aligned to sales segments with a geo breakout. Our number one focus is driving outbound MQLs, while collaborating across marketing (working closely with field marketing, sales, and SDRs in region) to develop strategies contributing to SAOs and closed won revenue against target accounts.

## Communication

In line with GitLab's overall [communication guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/), campaign managers work through MRs first and issues second (in order to preserve documentation), and our slack channel [#marketing_programs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCWUCP4MS) is used for team updated and quick questions.

The [#demand-gen](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CJFB4T7EX) channel is used for weekly check-ins and interaction with the larger demand generation team.

### Meeting Cadence

Most of our team meetings are recorded and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1GDkvqVhimLDnX744eh9YS6_qHhKRafmJ).

- Tuesdays - Campaign Team Connect Call (campaigns)
- Wednesdays - Demand Generation Team Call (campaigns, digital, partner)
- Thursdays - "No work talk" demand gen team hangout (campaigns, digital, partner)
- Thursdays - Marketing strategy & tactics call (all marketing)

### The Handbook

Is our single source of truth (SSoT) for processes and relevant links

- Individual teams should link back to these SSoT sections to avoid confusion
- Collaborative tactics contain their own handbook pages
- The handbook will be iterated on as we establish and optimize processes for optimal efficiency

## Project Management

### Campaigns Team Intake Process

Beginning Q3 FY21, the demand gen campaigns team will begin an issue intake process to evaluate comprehensive details of request and assign based on milestone bandwidth and priorities. Requests may be submitted using the correct issue templates.

Issues will be triaged as demonstrated in the diagram below. Please note: All required details in a given issue template must be completed in order for the SLA timeline to begin.

<div style="width: 600px;" class="embed-thumb"> <div style="position: relative; height: 0;overflow: hidden; height: 400px; max-width: 800px; min-width: 320px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: #d8d8d8;"> <div style="position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;z-index: 10; width: 600px; height: 100%;background: url(https://murally.blob.core.windows.net/thumbnails/gitlab2474/murals/gitlab2474.1598468466093-5f46b1720e54f644475491fc-61c7931a-18e2-4a73-90dd-eafcb724b939.png?v=27e40478-1cf5-43f3-8970-f6d66232a7d1) no-repeat center center; background-size: cover;"> <div style="position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;z-index: 20;width: 100%; height: 100%;background-color: white;-webkit-filter: opacity(.4);"> </div> <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1598468466093/3fecfe10c92a0e8b26403fe8e44305c6049185e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="transform: translate(-50%, -50%);top: 50%;left: 50%; position: absolute; z-index: 30; border: none; display: block; height: 50px; background: transparent;"> <img src="https://app.mural.co/static/images/btn-enter-mural.svg" alt="ENTER THE MURAL" width="233" height="50"> </a> </div> </div> <p style="margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 60px;line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;font-family: Proxima Nova, sans-serif;font-weight: 400; color: #888888;"> You will enter this mural in View Only mode. </p></div>

#### Intake process labels

- **mktg-status::triage** - the issue will be evaluated to determine if full details are included, and ask questions as needed if the scope/details are not clear
- **mktg-status::blocked** - there were insufficient details in the issue for work to be triaged
    - The requester must provide the details and then move the status back to `mktg-status::triage` in order for the request to be reviewed again.
    - Please note: issue submission does not begin the SLA timeline; sufficient details begin the SLA timeline
- **mktg-status::wip** - the issue is assigned and moved into appropriate time-based milestone
- **mktg-status::plan** - this is used for work that is in an earlier stage of planning and a specific request has not been made
    - This will likely be used mainly by campaign managers on issues that are not high priority but there is a desire to capture the idea/notes.

#### Intake process daily/weekly steps

1. Team manager completes daily review of [issues in triage](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1919630?&label_name%5B%5D=Marketing%20Programs) assessing the following standards:
    - are all details in the `Submitter Checklist` sufficiently complete in order to begin work? (if yes, request moves to "ready-to-build" status)
    - does the request align to an OKR? (if yes, prioritize)
    - does the request align to overall marketing goals? (if no, consider realistic timeline given priorities)
1. At the start of this process, we will test the process of accepting work:
    - upon add of "ready-to-build" status, the `volunteer` label will be applied, alerting the team
    - ideally the honor system will be met, with volunteer issues being picked up equally and spread across timezones - totals will be reviewed in milestone retro :heart:
    - if an issue is not picked up within 48 hours, team manager will assess team milestones and bandwidth to assign

#### Project management automation

Rules will now apply the "volunteer" label when an issue has been moved to the status of "ready-to-build" (campaign managers will subscribe to this label at the start of the triage process)

#### Shortcut issue comments for project management

**When a team member is picking up an issue from the backlog:**

```
/label ~"mktg-status::wip" 
/assign @
/milestone %mktg:
```

This will change the status to wip (work in progress), allow quick assignment and add to the appropriate milestone.

### Milestones

The campaigns team uses the overall 2-week marketing milestones (format of [Mktg: YYYY-MM-DD](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_title=mktg%3A+&state=&sort=)) to organize, prioritize, and balance campaigns, projects, and requests.

- The date in the milestone name is the END date of miltesone (Sunday)
- Note: Use of milestones was introduced to the campaigns team as of 2020-07-21.
- If issues in a milestone are not closed out by end of milestone, they are pulled to the next milestone. We will document **total issues** and **total weight** moved, to understand relative commitment levels and avoid overcommitment as we begin using milestones.

**Q3 FY21 Marketing Milestones:**

- [Mktg: 2020-08-02](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones/224)

### Tips & Tricks

#### Creating a MacBook shortcut for repetitive statements

**Example:** in an issue to update all of MPM, instead of typing out every name, I have added a shortcut in my computer to populate all of the MPMs GitLab handles when I type `asdf + Enter`.

**How to:**

- On your Mac, choose Apple menu (ever-present top left logo)
- Go to `System Preferences`
- Click the `Keyboard` section
- Click `Text` on the top nav options
- Cick the `+` at the bottom of the option list
- In `Replace` column, add the shortcut that you would type in to populate the repetitive text
- In `With` column, add the repetitive text that you want to populate when you type in the shortcut

# Reporting

## Integrated campaigns reporting

Marketing Programs uses Sisense dashboards to report on integrated campaigns performance, specifically:

1. [Demand Gen (Prev Integrated Campaigns) Overview Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/631669/Demand-Gen-(Prev-Integrated-Campaigns)-Overview-Dashboard):
This dashboard provides quick insights on campaign performance and monitors the impacts of campaign optimizations on various funnel metrics over the life of the campaign.
1. [Integrated Campaigns Table Summary](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/665451/Demand-Gen-(Prev-Integrated-Campaigns)-Table-Summary): This dashboard measures and compares the performance of integrated campaigns and channels within each campaign.

The Integrated Campaigns dashboards use [Bizible touchpoints](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible/#bizible-touchpoints) to track Inquiries, MQLs, and SDR Accepted metrics. We use the [Linear Bizible Attribution touchpoints model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible/#linear-attribution) to track Opportunities, Total IACV$, SAO, Pipeline IACV$, Won Deals count, and Won IACV $.

These dashboards were created by @aoetama and she is in the process of building out additional functionalities outlined in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/629).

### Key Metrics tracked on the Integrated campaign dashboards

- **Inquiries**: Form fills on the campaign landing page + form fills tagged with the campaign utms anywhere on our marketing site.
- **MQL**: Campaign inquiries that have MQL'ed (MQL date is not blank).
- **SDR Accepted**: Number of campaign inquiries worked by the SDRs.
- **New Inquiries**: Number of new emails created from campaign inquiries.
- **New MQL**: Number of new emails generated by campaign inquiries that have MQL'ed (MQL date is not blank).
- **New SDR Accepted**: Number of new emails generated by campaign inquiries worked by the SDRs.
- **[Linear] Opps Created**: Opportunities (All stages) attributed to campaign inquiries using the linear model.
- **[Linear] Total IACV $**: IACV $ value of opportunities (all stages) attributed to campaign inquiries using the linear model.
- **[Linear] SAO**: Sales Accepted opportunities (Stage 1+) attributed to campaign inquiries using the linear model.
- **[Linear] Pipeline IACV $**: IACV$ value of Sales Accepted opportunities (Stage 1+) attributed to campaign inquiries using the linear model.
- **[Linear] Won Deals**: Closed won opportunities attributed to campaign inquiries using the linear model.
- **[Linear] Won IACV$**: IACV$ value of Closed won opportunities attributed to campaign inquiries using the linear model.
- **Inquiry to MQL Conversion Rate**: Number of MQLs from the campaign(s)/Number of Inquiries from the campaign(s).
- **MQL to [Linear] SAO Conversion Rate**: Number of [Linear] SAOs from the campaign(s)/Number of MQLs from the campaign(s).
- **[Linear] SAO to [Linear] Closed Won Conversion Rate**: Number of [Linear] Won Deals from the campaign(s) / [Linear] SAOs from the campaign(s).

### 💡 Questions that the Integrated Campaign dashboards attempt to answer
