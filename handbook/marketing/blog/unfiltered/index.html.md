The GitLab Unfiltered blog is inspired by the spirit of [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency) and "[everyone can contribute](/company/strategy/#mission)." Team members can publish posts without going through the Editorial team for review, and we may choose some posts to feature on the main blog. You can publish as often as you like, get your posts up much faster, and don't need to ensure that they align with our content strategy.

Any GitLab team member can publish to the GitLab Unfiltered blog, provided they follow the process below, the post is relevant to GitLab or your work at GitLab (i.e. don't treat it as your personal blog), is in keeping with our [values](/handbook/values), and would not cast GitLab in a negative light. If you're not sure if your topic is appropriate for GitLab Unfiltered, please share your issue or merge request in #content on Slack to get feedback. If any team member publishes a post that is unsuitable they may have their right to publish revoked.

## Is my blog post right for Unfiltered?

Corporate news, product announcements, or any post which requires promotion from official GitLab branded channels should be published on the main GitLab blog. The process for submitting these posts is outlined in the [blog handbook](/handbook/marketing/blog/#publishing-process).

```mermaid

C --> H[Main blog]

```
### Examples:

- Company news: Launching a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging  initiative, announcing an event, sharing updates about an external-facing program
- Product announcements: A breaking change, new integration, announcing a partnership

 If you're still not sure where your post should live, ask in #content on Slack!

## Process

### Issue

Start by opening an issue in the [gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues) project, using the `unfiltered blog post` issue template.

### Merge request

Open a merge request for your blog post using the `unfiltered blog post` MR template. Make sure your MR is set to close your associated issue automatically.

Create your blog post file, following the instructions in the main [blog handbook](/handbook/marketing/blog/#formatting-guidelines). You may do this before you open your MR, depending on your preferred workflow.

#### Frontmatter

All blog post files begin with this frontmatter. Some fields from the [standard frontmatter for blog posts](/handbook/marketing/blog/#frontmatter) are unnecessary for Unfiltered posts, so to simplify things, you can copy and paste the below frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "This is the post title"
author: Firstname Lastname # if name includes special characters use double quotes "First Last"
author_gitlab: GitLab.com username # ex: johndoe
author_twitter: Twitter username or gitlab # ex: johndoe
categories: unfiltered
image_title: '/images/blogimages/gitlab-values-cover.png'
description: "Short description for the blog post"
tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 # Please add some relevant tags from the blog handbook: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/#tags
---
```

#### Link to disclaimer

Add the following to the top of your blog post file, underneath the frontmatter (leave one blank line in between):

```md
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<i class="fab fa-gitlab" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This blog post is [Unfiltered](/handbook/marketing/blog/unfiltered/#legal-disclaimer)
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fab fa-gitlab" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i>
{: .alert .alert-webcast}
```

This will render as follows:

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<i class="fab fa-gitlab" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This blog post is [Unfiltered](/handbook/marketing/blog/unfiltered/#legal-disclaimer)
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fab fa-gitlab" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i>
{: .alert .alert-webcast}

### Cover image

You can choose a cover image for yourself by following the [guidelines in the blog handbook](/handbook/marketing/blog/#cover-image), but if you prefer not to, please use the following in your frontmatter, which will apply the default cover image for Unfiltered posts.

`image_title: "/images/blogimages/gitlab-values-cover.png"`

### Review

As a final step, you might want to do a quick search of our blog to see if there are related posts you could include links to in your post. Cross-linking helps the reader and helps SEO, meaning more people will see what you've written. 

Please check [the review app for the blog post](/handbook/marketing/blog/#previewing-your-blog-post) to ensure there are no formatting problems (e.g. links not working, images not rendering).

When you are completely finished, assign your MR to another team member for review. This does not have to be a member of the Editorial or Content teams. In most cases you would assign someone from your own team or group to review. Ideally your reviewer should be someone familiar with the topic you are writing about, so that they can fact check as well as catch typos or grammatical errors.

#### If you are asked to review an Unfiltered post

- You might find this [editorial review checklist](/handbook/marketing/growth-marketing/content/editorial-team/#editorial-review-checklist) helpful
- Please ensure the `unfiltered` category has been entered in the post frontmatter
- Remove the line `featured: yes` from the frontmatter if present
- Please check [the review app for the blog post](/handbook/marketing/blog/#previewing-your-blog-post) to ensure there are no formatting problems (e.g. links not working, images not rendering)

### Merging

Your reviewer may be able to merge your post, but if they don't have maintainer access for the www-gitlab-com project you may need to assign the MR to someone else on your team to merge. You don't need to assign someone from the Editorial team to merge.

### Featured posts

The Editorial and PR teams will [monitor Unfiltered for blog posts that we may choose to polish and feature on the main blog](/handbook/marketing/growth-marketing/content/editorial-team/#featuring-unfiltered-posts) or develop into contributed articles for other publications. If you publish an Unfiltered post that you think could be a good fit for either of these, feel free to share it in #content.
