## Marketing Operations

Marketing Operations (MktgOps) supports the entire Marketing team to streamline processes and manage related tools. Due to those tools, we often support other teams at GitLab as well. MktgOps works closely with Sales Operations (SalesOps) to ensure information between systems is seamless, data is as accurate as possible and terminology is consistent in respective systems. Not only are we assisting with marketing operations but we are also involved in the operations of marketing, such as the budget and strategies.

Our team is structured as business partners to the rest of Marketing - see focus next to the names below.

Marketing Operations should be included in new tool evaluations to account for system integrations, budget, etc.

## Working with Marketing Operations

### Our Motto: If it isn't an Issue, it isn't OUR issue.

### Use of Issues

The MktgOps team works from issues and issue boards. If you are needing our assistance with any project, please open an issue and use the ~MktgOps::0 - To Be Triaged label anywhere within the GitLab repo. Prior to opening a new issue, feel free to reach out to your business partner to see if there is already a related issue that you can add your comments to.

With [Agile Delivery](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/agile-delivery/) being one of the solutions that GitLab (as a product) addresses, the Marketing Operations team aims to follow many of the agile methodologies. To help us in that effort, please create any Marketing Operations issues in the following format.

**Note:** This format is the [Agile user story](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-story-template/) format and helps the issue-requester (you) and the MOps team by clearly stating **what** as well as **why** for each request and concern.

**Format:** `As a _____ (role in marketing), I would like to ____________(need), so that ________________(reason).`

MktgOps uses a [global issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/825719) and will capture any issue in any group/sub-group in the repo since we work with so many other teams. There is also a [`Marketing Operations` project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations) within the [`Marketing` project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing).

### Use of Epics

In order to categorize various related issues, we will make use of epics to help a team member organize our work, especially if it crosses multiple milestones. If it is a MktgOps epic, we will add the `In Epic` label to it, so that we can easily see that it is part of an epic on our kanban board.

### Labeling

We use Labels for several purposes. One is to categorize the tool or area that is affected. Another is to show priority. And lastly, we may use them to identify the stage they are in, either before or after being put into a milestone/iteration. We generally use the stage labels for our kanban Columns.

**Categories:**

- `MktgOps - FYI`: Issue is not directly related to operations, no action items for MktgOps but need to be aware of the issue
- `MktgOps - Reporting`: Any reporting request for MktgOps
- `MktgOps - List Import`: Used for list imports of any kind - event or general/ad hoc (do not also use To Be Triaged scoped label)
- `Marketo`, `Bizible`, `Cookiebot`, `Demandbase`, `DiscoverOrg`, `Drift`, `GDPR`, `LeanData`, `LinkedIn Sales Navigator`, `Outreach-io`, `PathFactory`, `Periscope`, `Sigstr`: used to highlight one of our tech stack tools
- `In Epic`: bright yellow label to show that it is part of a MktgOps epic

**Priorities:**

- `MktgOps-Priority::1 - Top Priority`: Issue that is related to a breaking change, OKR focus, any other prioritized project by MktgOps leadership. This category will be limited because not everything can be a priority.
- `MktgOps-Priority::2 - Action Needed`: Issue has a specific action item for MktgOps to be completed with delivery date 90 days or less from issue creation date. This tag is to be used on projects/issues not owned by MktgOps (example: list upload).
- `MktgOps-Priority::3 - Future Action Needed`: Issue has a specific action item for MktgOps, the project/issue is not owned by MktgOps and delivery or event date is 90 days or more from issue creation.

**Stages:**

_Backlog_

- `MktgOps::0 - To Be Triaged`: Issue initially created, used in templates, the starting point for any label that involves MktgOps (except for List Uploads); no real discussion on the issue; generally unassigned
- `MktgOps::1 - Planning`: Issues assigned to a MktgOps team meber and are currently being scoped/considered but are not being actively worked on yet.
- `MktgOps::2 - On Deck`: Issues that have been scoped/considered and will be added to an upcoming iteration/milestone.
- `MktgOps::5 - On Hold`: Issue that is not within existing scope of Mktg OPS current targets, or another department as deprioritized. May be a precursor to being closed out.
- `MktgOps::6 - Blocked`: Issue that was being worked on by Mktg Ops and at least one other team wherein MktgOps is waiting for someone else/another team to complete an action item before being able to proceed. Could be locked by MktgOps-related task/issue, or external (non-GitLab) blocker.

_In Milestone_

- `MktgOps::3 - In Process`: Issues that are actively being worked on in the current two-week sprint/milestone.
- `MktgOps::4 - UAT`: Issues that MktgOps has completed its required tasks for and is ready for User Acceptance Testing/review and approval by the Requester/Approver.
- `MktgOps::7 - Completed`: MktgOps has completed their task on this issue although the issue may not be closed. The hope is that we will be using this one less as we simply scope an issue so that MktgOps can just close it when complete.

**Handbook Updates**: 

When making an update to a handbook page for `ABM`, `FMM`, `MOps`, or `SDR` handbook pages (or sub-pages), we have a Zapier workflow set up that will push the MR (upon merge) to the related slack channel to ensure our teams are aware of any change that is made to the page. In order for the merged MR to show up in the respective slack channel, you must add one of the following corresponding `labels` on the MR.


| Label you add | Slack channel the merged MR pushes to  |
| ------ | ------ |
| `MktgOps-HB Update` | `hbupdate-mktgops` |
| `FMM-HB Update` | `fieldmarketing-FYI` |
| `SDR-HB Update` | `hbupdate-sdr` |
| `ABM-HB Update` | `hbupdate-abm` |

## Operations Work Cadence

The MktgOps team works in two week sprints/iterations which are tracked as **Milestones** at the `GitLab.com` level. Each Ops individual contributor (IC) is responsible for adding issues to the milestone that will be completed in the two week time frame. If needed, the IC will separate the main issue into smaller pieces that are _workable_ segments of the larger request.

The MktgOps team will only create a milestone one beyond the current iteration, so at any given time there will be the **current** milestone and **upcoming** milestone, any other issue that is not included will be added into future milestones &/or added as work is completed in the current milestone.

A milestone cannot be closed nor marked complete until the milestone's accompanying merge request has been merged. Within every milestone there is a `WIP` merge request with all commits being changes to our handbook. All team members contribute their changes to the milestone merge request. The merge request should be tagged with marketing operations labels and the current milestone.

## No Meeting Fridays

The Marketing Operations team had started an experiment on 2020-04-20 to commit to no internal meetings one day of the week. Now the entire Marketing team has moved to Focus Fridays. Please try not to schedule meetings for team members on Fridays, so they can devote time for deep work in milestone-related issues. Thanks!

### Operational Timeline of Changes

Periodically Marketing Operations makes significant changes to our system and processes that affect overall tools, data and reporting or uncovers significant changes that affected reporting. As such we have an [Operational timeline of events](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vhGvEszndMJ4B9EshGFSdTTABwUzBzDObz93vkMSFGA). The MktgOps team updates this document as needed as changes are made.

## Marketing Expense Tracking

| GL Code | Account Name | Purpose |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- |
| 6060 | Software Subscriptions | All software subscriptions |
| 6100 | Marketing | Reserved for Marketing GL accounts |
| 6110 | Marketing Site | All agency fees and contract work intended to improve the marketing site |
| 6120 | Advertising | All media buying costs as well as agency fees and software subscriptions related to media buying |
| 6130 | Events | All event sponsorships, booth shipping, event travel, booth design, event production as well as agency fees and software costs related to events |
| 6135 | Swag | Any swag related expense |
| 6140 | Email | All 3rd party email sponsorships as well as agency fees and software costs related to mass email communications and marketing automation |
| 6150 | Brand | All PR, AR, content, swag and branding costs |
| 6160 | Prospecting | Not used - All costs related to prospecting efforts |

### Invoice Approval

Marketing Operations approves any invoices that have not already been coded and approved through a Finance issue or that exceed the original cost estimate. We make use of Tipalti for this process. Team leads will confirm that services were performed or products were received also through Tipalti. Campaign tags are used to track costs related to events and campaigns.

## Lead Scoring, Lead Lifecycle, and MQL Criteria

A Marketing Qualified Lead is a lead that has reached a certain threshold, we have determined to be 90 points accumulated, based on demographic/firmographic and/or behavioral information. The `Person Score` is comprised of various actions and/or profile data that are weighted with positive or negative point values. Every time a `Person Score` is updated, LeanData will run a check to see if the record needs to be processed through the flow.

### MQL Scoring Model

The overall model is based on a 100 point system. Positive and negative points are assigned to a record based on their demographic and/or firmographic information, and their behavior and/or engagement with GitLab marketing. You can find granular scoring on the [Marketo Page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo#mql-scoring-model).

## Campaign Cost Tracking

Marketing Program Managers track costs associated with campaigns - such as events, content, webcasts, etc. Campaign tags can be applied to Expensify reports, corporate credit card charges, and vendor bills processed by Accounts Payable. Campaign expenses that are incurred by independent contractors should be clearly noted with the appropriate tag and included in their invoices to the company. We then use these accumulated campaign tag costs for budget to actual analysis as well as to update the Salesforce campaigns with actual costs.

**The following steps are used to create and manage campaign tags:**

1. Event Owners create the campaign tag in the budget document, link to a procurement issue if it exists, and also the main tactic issue. 
1. Finance is notified by either the Procurement issue or the main tactic issue (if the tactic costs less than $5,000 and has no contract that needs to be signed) that a campaign tag needs to be created.  NetSuite, which then updates Expensify nightly.
1. The Salesforce campaign is set up to match the campaign tag exactly, so that it can be used as a unique identifier and tracked across multiple systems. We only need to set up campaign tags for events/campaigns or if there are multiple vendors for the same budget line item that we are trying to track.
1. If you are a Field Marketer, more information on campaign tags for Field Marketing can be [found here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-tags). 
1. For the MPM team, additional details can be found in the campaign epic. 

**Things to Note:**

- All costs, including travel expenses for those working the event, must be tagged in order to capture the true cost of campaigns. Although travel expenses related to putting on the event hit a different GL code, they should be budgeted within the event line.
- Tagging expenses that are processed by Accounts Payable require Marketing to provide explicit instruction on when to apply tags, which should happen during the normal course of reviewing and approving vendor invoices.
- For event or campaign expenses that do not have a tag, include a note to Accounts Payable clearly stating that campaign tags are not applicable to the expense. In some cases, a general tag like Swag_Corporate may be more a more appropriate tag to track against budget.

## Marketing Gearing Ratios
Gearing ratios are used as business drivers to forecast long term financial goals by function. Refer to the [FP&A handbook](/handbook/finance/financial-planning-and-analysis/#business-drivers-also-known-as-gearing-ratios) for further details on how gearing ratios enable planning and forecasting. 

The gearing ratios for marketing are as follows:

- **Inquiries per MQL**: at the top of the marketing funnel, this is the conversion rate at which [Inquiries](/handbook/business-ops/resources/#glossary) become Marketing Qualified Leads ([MQL's](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#lead-scoring-lead-lifecycle-and-mql-criteria)).
- **MQL to SAO**: this is the mid-funnel conversion rate at which MQL's become Sales Accepted Opportunities ([SAO's](/handbook/business-ops/resources/#criteria-for-sales-accepted-opportunity-sao)).
- **SAO to Closed-Won**: at the bottom of the marketing funnel, this is the rate at which SAO's move through the full pipeline to [closed won](/handbook/sales/#forecast-categories-definitions), resulting in a sale.
- **Pipe-to-Spend**: is the ratio of pipeline created that is attributed to demand generation program spend. The target ratio is 5:1 for pipe-to-spend.
- **XDR MQL Disposition/Month**: is the capacity of an ([XDR](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/xdr/)) to convert MQL's into SAO's. Total MQL's converted to SAO's / Qty of XDR's
- **New IACV Average Deal Size**: is the average deal size of new customer transactions by segment and geography
- **Marketing E/R and long-term profitability target**: is marketing operating expense divided by revenue (ratable) as shown on the income statement. The long term target profitability target for Marketing E/R is 13%. This target includes the operating expense related to free usage of gitlab.com. See gitlab financial model for yearly targets of this gearing ratio.

## Email Management

Email database management is a core responsibility for MktgOps. Ensuring GitLab is following email best practices, in compliance with Global spam laws and overall health of active database are all priorities.

Email creation, campaigns, follow up reporting and sending is the responsibility of the Marketing Program Managers. To request an email of any kind, please see the [instructions](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/emails-nurture/#ad-hoc-one-time-emails---requesting-an-email) in the revenue marketing section of the handbook.

### Email Communication Policy  

At GitLab, we strive to communicate with people in a way that is beneficial to them. Most of our email marketing communications follow an explicit opt-in policy, although at times, we will communicate via email to people who have not explicitly opted-in. We do this to offer something of value (ex. an invite to a workshop, dinner, the opportunity to meet an industry leader, etc. not an email inviting to read a blog post) to the person. We always include the unsubscribe link in our communications, and we respect the unsubscribe list. In addition to the unsubscribe button at the bottom of all of our emails, we have available our [Email Subscription Center](/company/preference-center/), where people can control their email communication preferences.

Certain emails can bypass unsubscribe by being marked as `operational`. Operational emails need to be transactional and should not be marketing in nature. Examples include critical system alerts, auto-responder emails after an action is taken (ex. registration confirmation), event reminders with link to attend event, post event recording, and account balances.
Emails that contain mostly marketing or promotional content like newsletters, event invites and sales emails are not considered `operational`. Only Mops and certain MPMs have access to this feature in Marketo. If you have any questions on whether or not your email is operational, contact Mops and/or Legal.

### Email Segments

Database segments and how someone subscribes to specific segment:

- **Newsletter**: Users can [subscribe to the newsletter](/company/contact/) through the blog, Contact us page, and CE download page.
- **Security Alerts**: [Subscribe to security notices](/company/contact/#security-notices) on the GitLab Contact us page.
- **Webcasts**: When someone registers to a live or on-demand webcast
- **Live Events**: When someone registers to attend a live event, meet up or in-person training. Use of this segment is narrowed down by geolocation so notification and invitation emails are specific to related area.

### Types of Email

**Breaking Change Emails**
These are transactional emails, almost always to our user base, that provide very selective needed information. This is an operational-type email that overrides the unsubscribe and would not need to comply with marketing email opt-out. Usage example: GitLab Hosted billing change, Release update 9.0.0 changes, GitLab Page change and Old CI Runner clients.
It is very important to have Engineering and/or Product team (whoever is requesting this type of email) help us narrow these announcements to the people that actually should be warned, so we are communicating to a very specific targeted list.

**Newsletter**
Sent bi-monthly (every 2 weeks). Content Team is responsible for creating the content for each Newsletter.

**Security Alerts**
Sent on an as needed basis containing important information about any security patches, identified vulnerabilities, etc. related to the GitLab platform. These emails are purely text based and again are transactional in nature.

**Webcasts**
Invitation and/or notification emails sent about future webcasts.

**Live Events**
Invitation emails to attend a live event (VIP or Executive Lunch), meet-up, or in-person training. These emails are sent to a geo-locational subset of the overall segment. This type of email is also used when we are attending a conference and want to make people aware of any booth or event we may be holding and/or sponsoring.

## Website Form Management

The forms on about.gitlab are embedded Marketo forms. Any changes to the fields, layout, labels and CSS occur within Marketo and can be pushed live without having to make any changes to the source file on GitLab. When needing to change or embed a whole new form, ping MktgOps on the related issue so appropriate form and subsequent workflows can be created.

Each Marketo form should push an event after successful submission to trigger events in Google Analytics. We use the following event labels to specify which events to fire.

1. `demo` for static demos on `/demo/` and `/demo-leader/`
1. `webcasts` for forms on any page in `/webcast/`
1. `trial` for the form on `/free-trial/`
1. `resources` for forms on any page in `/resources/`
1. `events` for forms on any page in `/events/`
1. `services` for form on `/services/`
1. `sales` for form on `/sales/`
1. `public-sector` for forms on `/solutions/public-sector/`
1. `mktoLead` legacy custom event label used on Newsletter subscription form submission events. Currently used for primary, security, and all-remote newsletter form submissions.

We add the following line above `return false` in the form embed code. Please update the event label from `demo` to reflect the appropriate form completion.

```
dataLayer.push(
{
  'event' : 'demo', 
  'mktoFormId' : form.getId(),
  'eventCallback' : function()
  {}, 'eventTimeout' : 3000
});
```

In the event Marketo has an outage and/or the forms go offline, the forms with highest usage/visibility (Free Trial and Contact Us) have been recreated as Google forms that can be embedded on the related pages as a temporary measure to minimize any effect till the outage is past.

## Initial Source

`Initial Source` is the first "known" touch attribution or when a website visitor becomes a known name in our database, once set it should never be changed or overwritten. For this reason Salesforce is set up so that you are unable to update both the `Initial Source` and `Lead Source` fields. If merging records, keep the `Initial Source` that is oldest (or set first). When creating Lead/Contact records and you are unsure what `Initial Source` should be used, ask in the `#lead-questions` Slack channel.

The values listed below are the only values currently supported. If you attempt to upload or import leads or contacts into Salesforce without one of these initial sources you will encounter a validation rule error. If you think that there needs to be a new Initial Source added to this list and into Salesforce please slack the appropriate team member(s) listed in the [Tech Stack](/handbook/business-ops/tech-stack-applications/#tech-stack-applications).

The `Initial Source` table below is current as of 7 July 2020.

Status in the table below means:

- Active = can be selected from picklist
- Inactive = cannot be selected from picklist, but a record may exist with this source

- **Name the program using the campaign tag**

##### Step 2: Sync to Salesforce

- At the program main screen in Marketo, where it says `Salesforce Sync` "not set", click on "not set"
    - Click "Create New." The program will automatically populate the campaign tag, so you do not need to edit anything.
    - Click "Save"

##### Step 3: Update Marketo tokens

- Complete the information for each token. Instructions for what to enter for each token are included in the template.
    - Note that it is important that all tokens are completed as the "Interesting Moments" Smart Campaigns pushes information to Salesforce based on the tokens. Depending on the campaign, some auto-responders and emails rely on tokens as well.
    - You do not need to update the following tokens upon setup:
        - ((my.email header image url}} - This is optional. You will need this if you had custom images created.
        - {{my.ondemandurl}} - This will be entered AFTER the event date. It is the link to the recorded webcast. You will need to come back after the event and update this token.
- Update the utm_campaign field using the following format: Campaign Tag, with no spaces, capitalization, underscores, or special characters.

##### Step 4: Activate Marketo smart campaign(s)
* If this is a `Vendor Arranged Meeting` or `Executive Roundtable`, skip this step. The campaign and interesting moments will be run as a batch campaign after the list is loaded.
* Click the "Smart Campaigns" folder
     * Select the `Interesting Moments` smart campaign. 
     * The correct program should automatically apply when cloned, so *you don't need to do anything here.* However, you can confirm that the campaign tag appears on in the Smart List and Flow. If the name of the template appears anywhere, replace it with the campaign tag.
     * Click to the "Schedule" tab and click `Activate`.
     * Select the `01 Processing` smart campaign.
     * The correct program should automatically apply when cloned, so *you don't need to do anything here.* However, you can confirm that the campaign tag appears on in the Smart List and Flow. If the name of the template appears anywhere, replace it with the campaign tag.
     * Click to the "Schedule" tab and click `Activate`.

- Keep in mind, sometimes the interesting moment happens in the `01 processing` campaign. If you do not see an `Interesting Moments` campaign, check to see if that step is in `01 Processing`

##### Step 5: Update the Salesforce campaign

- Now go to Salesforce.com and check the [All Campaigns by create date](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/701?fcf=00B4M000004oVF9) view. Sort by create date and your campaign should appear at the top. You may also search for your campaign tag in the search box. Select the campaign.
    - Change the `Campaign owner` to your name
    - Change the `Enable Bizible Touchpoints` to `Include only "Responded" Campaign Members`
    - Confirm that start date and end date populated correctly (this is automated). For events and webcasts, start date is 30 days prior to the event date and 60 days after. For all other campaigns, the start date is the date of launch, end date is 90 days from the date of launch (or if the campaign runs longer, update to the appropriate end date).
    - Update the event epic
    - Update the description (if any)
    - Update `Budgeted Cost`
    - Update `Region` and `Sub-region`, if these are local or targeted to a specific region
    - Update `Budget Holder`, if the campaign results in offline Bizible touchpoints based on campaign type (i.e. content syndication, sponsored webcast, etc.) - NOTE: an offling Bizible touchpoint happens when we gather a lead offline and in order for the system to have this name you must go through a [list upload process](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/list-import/).
    - Click "Save"
- Add the Marketo program link and SFDC campaign link to the epic.

#### Steps to Setup Content Syndication in Marketo and SFDC

##### Step 1: [Clone this program](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#PG5149A1)

- Use format `YYYY_Vendor_NameofAsset`
- If the content syndication is part of a package with an external vendor, promoting several assets or webcasts, keep all of the Marketo programs together in a folder for easy access as part of a single vendor program.

##### Step 2: Sync to Salesforce

- At the program main screen in Marketo, where it says `Salesforce Sync` with "not set", click on "not set"
    - Click "Create New." The program will automatically populate the campaign tag, so you do not need to edit anything.
    - Click "Save"

##### Step 3: Update Marketo tokens

- Change the `Content Title` to be the title as it appears in the Content Syndication program
- Change the `Content Type` to be the type of content
    - The only available options are `Whitepaper`, `eBook`, `Report`, `Video`, or `General`
    - If you add a Content Type value other than the above, the record will hit an error when syncing to Salesforce because these are the only currently available picklist items for `Initial Source`

##### Step 4: Activate Marketo smart campaign

- In the `01 Downloaded` smart campaign, the "Smart List" should be listening for `Added to List > Vendor List`. This list is under the Asset folder in the program. It will contain all of the members that were uploaded who downloaded the content.
    - The correct program should automatically apply when cloned, so _you don't need to do anything here._
- In the `01 Downloaded` smart campaign, the "Flow" will trigger a program status change `Content Syndication > Downloaded`, that will trigger a scoring update. An interesting moment to be applied, the `Person Source` (note: this maps to `Initial Source` in Salesforce) will update IF a `Person Source` does not already exist (i.e. it is blank), the `Acquisition Program` will set if blank, the Marketo `Initial Source` will populate if blank, and the `Person Status` will update to `Inquiry` if `Blank` or `Raw`.
- Click to the "Schedule" tab and click `Activate`. It should be set that a person can only run through the flow once.
    - When the leads are loaded to the campaign by Marketing Ops, the leads will immediately have an interesting moment, +15 score, and initial source, person source and person status update as needed.

##### Step 5: Update the Salesforce campaign

- Now go to Salesforce.com and check the [All Campaigns by create date](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/701?fcf=00B4M000004oVF9) view. Sort by create date and your campaign should appear at the top. You may also search for your campaign tag in the search box. Select the campaign.
    - Change the `Campaign Owner` to your name
    - Change the `Enable Bizible Touchpoints` to `Include only "Responded" Campaign Members`
    - Update the event epic
    - Update the description
    - Update `Start Date` to the date of launch
    - Update `End Date` to 90 days from date of launch (if this is an ongoing campaign, update appropriately)
    - Update `Budgeted Cost` if you have the data available
    - Update `Region` and `Subregion` if you have the data available
    - Click Save
- Add the Marketo program link and SFDC campaign link to the epic.

#### Steps to Setup SimplyDirect Surveys in Marketo and SFDC
Simply Direct will provide you with an unique `Survey Name` that they will pass over into Marketo via the API populating the `Person Source` and the `SurveyName` fields. This name is unique to each survey that is ran. `Person Source` will not update if the lead already exists in Marketo.

SimplyDirect is also passing over the survey Q&A through the `Comment Capture` field. This will populate via a URL on the Interesting Moment and the `Web Form` field, so that the SDR following up will have full access to all of the survey questions and answers.


##### Step 1: [Clone this program](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#PG6164A1)
- Use format `YYYY_MM_SurveyName`

##### Step 2: Sync to Salesforce

- At the program main screen in Marketo, where it says `Salesforce Sync` with "not set", click on "not set"
    - Click "Create New." The program will automatically populate the campaign tag, so you do not need to edit anything.
    - Click "Save"

##### Step 3: Update SurveyName across Smart Lists and Flows
- Contact SimplyDirect and ask for the SurveyName they will pass to Marketo
- Click into `01 Processing`
     - In Smart List, change every `SurveyName` to the name you were given. There are 3 fields on the smartlist you must change. Tokens will not work, you must update in the smart list. Do not include any extra spaces!
     - In the Flow, on step 1 `Change Data Value` update `SurveyName` to the name you were given.
     - Click to the "Schedule" tab and click `Activate`. It should be set that a person can only run through the flow once.
- BEFORE launch of the survey, have SimplyDirect send an existing lead, and a new lead through to make sure both are being captured.


##### Step 4: Update the Salesforce campaign

- Now go to Salesforce.com and check the [All Campaigns by create date](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/701?fcf=00B4M000004oVF9) view. Sort by create date and your campaign should appear at the top. You may also search for your campaign tag in the search box. Select the campaign.
    - Change the `Campaign Owner` to your name
    - Change the `Enable Bizible Touchpoints` to `Include only "Responded" Campaign Members`
    - Update the event epic
    - Update the description
    - Update `Start Date` to the date of launch
    - Update `End Date` to 90 days from date of launch (if this is an ongoing campaign, update appropriately)
    - Update `Budgeted Cost` if you have the data available
    - Update `Region` and `Subregion` if you have the data available
    - Click Save
- Add the Marketo program link and SFDC campaign link to the epic.

##### Step 5: Troubleshooting:
1. Look at the `Results` tab of the smart campaign, if there are errors, you will clearly see them there.
1. If the lead is not pushing to SFDC? Make sure that the `Person Source` is not `SurveyName`
1. If existing leads are not being pulled into the program, it is likely the `SurveyName` field is capturing the wrong name.
1. If net-new leads are not being pulled into the program, it is likely the `Person Source` SurveyName was not updated correctly.


## Campaigns

Campaigns are used to track efforts of marketing tactics - field events, webcasts, content downloads. The campaign types align with how marketing tracks spend and align the way records are tracked across three of our core systems (Marketo, Salesforce and Bizible) for consistent tracking. Leveraging campaign aligns our efforts across Marketing, Sales and Finance.

### Campaign Type & Progression Status

A record can only progress **one-way** through a set of event statuses. A record _cannot_ move backward though the statuses.

i.e. Record is put into `Registered` cannot be moved backward to `Waitlisted`

#### Cohort

A method of tracking a group (cohort) of targeted known records and/or records included in an ABM strategy.
