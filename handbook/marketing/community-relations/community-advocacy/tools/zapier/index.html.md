### Zapier subscription

We use Zapier to automate the task of identifying mentions of GitLab across our [Community Response channels](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-advocacy/#community-response-channels) and generally convert them to actionable Zendesk tickets

The Zapier subscription runs on the [Team](https://zapier.com/app/billing/plans) plan, and is shared with the rest of the GitLab team

### Zapier access

- URL: [https://zapier.com](https://zapier.com)
- Account: search for the shared Zapier account in 1Password's `Team` vault 

Once logged in, you can access, edit and create Zaps in the [Community Relations](https://zapier.com/app/zaps/folder/275996) folder
