## Overview

The Community Advocacy team may choose to run workflow changes or new programs as a pilot program for 90 days. 

The team is allowing and implementing pilots in order to:

* Be sure a new workflow or program is effective
* Avoid overriding previous programs or workflows while trying out something new
* Encourage advocates to consider ideas that are divergent from the status quo with less fear of it not working

## Workflow

**Identify goals:**

The first step is to outline clear goals and objectives for the pilot program. 

**Identify handbook changes:**

Identify which program or process the pilot will replace. Document which parts of the handbook will be overwritten.

**Create timeline (90 days max):**

Once you have determined your goals, set up 4 calendar reminders (1 weeks, 1 months, 2 months, 3 months) to check in on program progress, problems, and finally to determine whether or not to finalize the pilot as a formal program. 

**Identify a DRI:**

Determine who is responsible for the program and who that person will be working closely for the duration of the pilot.

**Analyze data:**

Data is essential to make informed decisions. Metrics should indicate, clearly, where you are in relation to your goals. Good metrics are always trackable, important, and explainable. If youâ€™re unable to formally track and analyze data, ensure a group vote is taken at the end of the pilot to determine whether the team agrees to formalize the pilot.
