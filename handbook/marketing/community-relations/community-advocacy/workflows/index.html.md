## Communicating workflow changes

- Join [#advocates-fyi](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C016JETG68Y/details/members) in Slack to stay updated on workflow changes. Once an advocate has read a post in #advocates-fyi, they must post a green check mark emoji reaction indicating that it has been viewed. If you've submitted an MR for workflow changes, post a summary of the changes in #advocates-fyi once the merge request is complete.
