## Requesting Swag

This page outlines ways that GitLab team members can request swag. If you are looking to host a giveaway of GitLab swag, please review the [GitLab Giveaways process](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-advocacy/workflows/merchandise-handling/giveaways/).

### Important Notes

We recommend that you request merchandise **at least 4 weeks in advance** for us to be able to accommodate your request. If your request is urgent, please reach out to the community advocates via <merch@gitlab.com> to find out if an expediated shipping option is available.

Other ways you can get support for your swag request:
* Tag the @advocates in the [#swag Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C66R8N98F/thread/CB16DMSLC-1594317317.394500)
* In order to keep the orders transparent, please do not send requests via direct messages. Instead, email <merch@gitlab.com>.
