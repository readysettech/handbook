## Marketing Program Managers

Marketing Program Managers focus on executing, measuring and scaling GitLab's marketing campaigns, landing a message strategically focused on a target audience using channels such as email nurture, digital ads, paid and organic social, events, and more. Marketing programs work with Content Marketing and Product Marketing to activate content in the most effective manner to drive leads for SDRs and Sales. Webcasts, gated content, and Pathfactory strategy/best practices are owned by the Digital Marketing Programs team.

### Communication
In line with GitLab's overall [communication guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/), MPMs work through MRs first and issues second (in order to preserve documentation), and our slack channel [#marketing_programs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCWUCP4MS) is used for team updated and quick questions. The [#demand-gen](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CJFB4T7EX) channel is used for weekly check-ins and interaction with digital marketing.

# How we work together

The Marketing Programs team is heavily focused on building and following the most efficient processes possible in order to drive our top initiatives (integrated campaigns and virtual events being two examples that are highly cross-functional) using clear workback schedules, SLAs, DRIs, and strong communication. As such, for big cross-collaborative projects and tactics relying on multiple teams, we work out of GoogleDocs that use formulas and calculations to produce workback schedules, taking into account all other teams' required SLAs so as to work most cohesively - no firedrills :fire: if we can help it!

*This may be where you think, "We should be working in GitLab, not in GoogleDocs.* **Not to fear! Everything we are planning and executing is within GitLab issues and epics as detailed below.** *The high-level capture of everything happening, and the SLA workback schedule formulas are where the GoogleDocs are critical.*

## Key MPM tactics with links to processes and GoogleDocs with high level organization + timelines

#### 📌 Integrated campaigns
* [Processes defined in the Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/campaigns/#campaign-planning)
* [GoogleDoc for workback schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VTrWNX9qfY99b2TnrX93P39aXiRoNnChB6tduTvmysA/edit#gid=1426779885) - details all issues, DRIs, due dates based on calculations, etc. that takes into account SLAs of other teams, highly collaborative process managed by MPM DRIs working with DRIs across all of marketing.
* Example, for Q2 campaigns, we determine launch will be on June 15. The MPM puts June 15 into cell B2 and the entire workback is defined based on other team SLAs toward goal launch date.

#### 📌 Webcasts
* [Processes defined in the Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/webcast/#project-planning)
* [GoogleDoc for workback schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VTrWNX9qfY99b2TnrX93P39aXiRoNnChB6tduTvmysA/edit#gid=1899924336) - details all issues, DRIs, due dates based on calculations, etc. that takes into account SLAs of other teams, collaborative process managed by MPM DRIs working with DRIs relevant to the webcast.

#### 📌 Gated Content
* [Processes defined in the Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/gated-content/#internal-content-created-by-the-gitlab-team)
* [GoogleDoc for workback schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mw16Ft0Wo379dT6OYingQ5A4xXTT1EjdpD6k-lgQync/edit#gid=1060299991) - details due dates based on calculations and organizes overall calendar, collaborative process between MPMs and Content Marketing.

#### 📌 Analyst Content
* [Processes defined in the Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/gated-content/#analyst-content-delivered-by-analysts)
* [GoogleDoc for workback schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mw16Ft0Wo379dT6OYingQ5A4xXTT1EjdpD6k-lgQync/edit#gid=1491223980) - details due dates based on calculations and organizes overall calendar, collaborative process between MPMs, Analyst Relations, and Analysts themselves.
* In addition to the setup process, we have a strict process to [remove resources when we no longer have legal rights to use the assets]() (big project to hammer out how to do this across our website, pathfactory, landing pages, marketo, and making sure links aren't in use)

#### 📌 Events
* [Processes defined in the Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/events/#mpm-steps-to-set-up-event-epic)
* [GoogleDoc for workback schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mw16Ft0Wo379dT6OYingQ5A4xXTT1EjdpD6k-lgQync/edit#gid=0) - details due dates based on calculations and organizes overall calendar, collaborative process between MPMs and FMMs.

#### 📌 External (Non-GitLab Hosted) Virtual Events
* [Processes defined in the Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/external-virtual-events/) - includes **sponsored webcasts** and **virtual conferences**

#### 📌 Direct Mail
* [Process defined in the Handook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/direct-mail/)

## Timeline Guidelines

The following are some timelines to help in generating workback schedules for campaigns and tactics. These are not comprehensive, and campaigns should be planned as far in advance as possible. Bare minimum timeline is indicated, but when possible it is best to have prep done in advance of setup to reduce friction if dependencies don't meet deadlines.

**Invitation Emails:**

Dependency: *MOps target list* must be requested through an issue, aligning to MOps timeline must be requested as part of the campaign/tactic.

Bare minimum timeline:
* T-10 BD (2 weeks) from planned send date: Issue must be opened by requeseter
* T-7 BD from planned send date: Copy due from requester (note: if copy is not provided by deadline, the send will be pushed out.)
* T-5 BD from planned send date: Test email sent to requester by MPM
* T-4 BD from planned send date: All requested changes from requester incorporated into email by MPM
* T-2 BD from planned send date: Email is set to send by MPM

**Follow Up Email:**

Dependency: for any offline campaigns/tactics (i.e. event, sponsored webcast) *MOps list upload issue* must be requested through an issue, aligning to MOps timeline must be requested as part of the campaign/tactic.

Bare minimum timeline:
* T-10 BD (2 weeks) from planned send date: Issue must be opened by requester
* T-7 BD from planned send date: Copy due from requester (note: if copy is not provided by deadline, the send will be pushed out.)
* T-5 BD from planned send date: Test email sent to requester by MPM
* T-4 BD from planned send date: All requested changes from requester incorporated into email by MPM
* T-2 BD from planned send date: Email is set to send by MPM

**Add to nurture:**

Dependency: for any offline campaigns/tactics (i.e. event, sponsored webcast) *MOps list upload issue* must be requested through an issue, aligning to MOps timeline must be requested as part of the campaign/tactic.

* T-10 BD (2 weeks) from planned follow up send date: Issue must be opened by requester
* T-7 BD from planned follow up send date: Requester notifies in the issue which nurture stream (and buyer stage) to add the leads to
* T+1 BD from planned follow up send date: campaign members added to the nurture stream indicated by requester, completed by MPM
  * If no follow  up email indicated, leads can also be added to nurture T+1 BD from list upload

**Landing Pages:**

* T-15 BD (3 weeks) from planned launch date: Issue must be opened by requester
* T-10 BD (2 weeks) from planned launch date: Copy due from requester (if copy is not provided on time, launch will be pushed out)
* T-5 BD from planned launch date: Test landing page provided to requester by MPM

Note: complex requests (single landing page for multiple events, a page with a custom form, or email design that falls outside of a currently available template) will require additional time and MPM/MOps will discuss timeline upon review of the campaign (in Plan state).

## Marketing Programs project management
This section will be built out as we move forward with the ideal state project management for a cohesive approach with Marketing.

### Marketing Programs issues and issue templates
All issue templates in our project in GitLab begin with a recommended naming convention for the issue as well as a set of quickactions to organize action items and assist with prioritization:

```
> NAME THIS ISSUE: [naming convention] (ex. [example])

> NAME THIS ISSUE: Marketo LP and Automation: [landing page name] (ex. Marketo LP and Automation: [eBook] A beginner's guid to GitOps)

> MUST DO: Add due date from the relevant workback schedule in the [list of options](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/landing-pages/#marketo-landing-page-instructions-character-limits-and-workback-timelines), add MPM, url for epic, and relevant `Mktg: [end date]` milestone.

<!-- UPDATE - PROECT MANAGEMENT DETAILS --> 

/assign @
/epic 
/due 
/milestone %

<!-- ISSUE DETAILS -->

[more here depending on the issue template selected]

<!-- PROJECT MANAGEMENT LABELS -->
/label ~mktg-demandgen ~"Marketing Programs" ~"mktg-status::wip" ~"Gated Content"
/weight 
```

* `/assign @` - add just one DRI based on who will complete the work in the issue. If work needs to be completed by multiple people, break into separate issues with clear deliverables and due dates. (example: `/assign @jgragnola`)
* `/due 2020-` - add due date based on workback schedules (example: `/due 2020-07-13` or `/due tomorrow` or `/due 07/13/2020`)
* `/milestone %` - add milestone based on the due date of the issue (example: `/milestone %"Mktg: `)
* `/weight ` - add weight between 1-5, with 1 being easiest (between 1-4 hours of time) and 5 being most complext (a full week of work). If work will span more than a week, break into separate issues. (example: `/weight 1`)
* `/epic ` - add epic of the overarching campaign or project (example: `/epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370`)

### Marketing Programs labels in GitLab

* **Marketing Programs**: General labels to track all issues related to Marketing Programs. This brings the issue into the board for actioning.
* **MPM Priority**: to be used by MPMs to organize their top priority tasks. These are not to be applied by other team members.
* **MPM - Radar**: Holding place for any issues that will need Marketing Program Manager support, including gated content, events, webcasts, etc.
* **MPM - Supporting Epic / Issue Created**: Indicates that the epic and supporting issues were created for the MPM - Radar issue. At the time this label is applied, the "MPM - Radar" label will be removed.
* **MPM - Secure presenters and schedule dry runs**: Used when MPM is securing presenters and Q&A support for an upcoming virtual event.
* **MPM - Landing Page & Design**: Used by Marketing Program Manager to indicate that the initiative is in the stage of landing page creation and requesting design assets from the web/design team.
* **MPM - Marketo Flows**: Used by Marketing Program Manager to indicate that the initiative is in the stage of editing/testing of flows in Marketo.
* **MPM - Create Target List**: Used by Marketing Program Manager requested of Marketing Ops and in collaboration with Field Marketing to receive a list curated for the geo target. Marketo smart lists for larger metro areas around the world are built to expedite list creation. Additional curation done in Salesforce.
* **MPM - Invitations & Reminder**: Used by Marketing Program Manager when the initiative is in the stage of identifying segmentation to target and outreach strategy.
* **MPM - Follow Up Emails**: Used by Marketing Program Manager when initiative is in the stage of writing and reviewing relevant emails (reminders, follow up, etc.).
* **MPM - Add to Nurture**: Used by Marketing Program Manager when initiative is in the stage of being added to nurture.
* **MPM - Project**: For non-campaign based optimizations, ideation, and projects of Marketing Program Managers
* **MPM - Blocked/Waiting**: Designates that the MPM is blocked by another team member from moving forward on the issue.
* **MPM - Switch to On-demand**: Used by Marketing Program Manager when switching webcast landing page and subsequent marketo programs to on-demand post event.
* **MPM - Ad Hoc Email**: Used by Marketing Program Manager to organize ad hoc email requests coming in from different teams. Worked into overarching email marketing strategy.

## List views of labels

Issue list views allow sorting by due date, created date, and more. Below are some of the key issue views that the Marketing Program Team monitors for in-progress and upcoming action items:
* [MPM Priority](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=MPM%20Priority)
* [Landing Pages](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=opened&label_name[]=MPM%20-%20Landing%20Page%20%26%20Design)
* [Invitations & Reminder Emails](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=MPM%20-%20Invitations%20%26%20Reminder)
* [Follow Up Emails](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=MPM%20-%20Follow%20Up%20Emails)
* [Add to Nurture](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=MPM%20-%20Add%20to%20Nurture)
* [MPM - Radar](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=MPM%20-%20Radar)

### Tips & Tricks

#### Creating a MacBook shortcut for repetitive statements
**Example:** in an issue to update all of MPM, instead of typing out every name, I have added a shortcut in my computer to populate all of the MPMs GitLab handles when I type `asdf + Enter`.

**How to:**
* On your Mac, choose Apple menu (ever-present top left logo)
* Go to `System Preferences`
* Click the `Keyboard` section
* Click `Text` on the top  nav options
* Cick the `+` at the bottom of the option list
* In `Replace` column, add the shortcut that you would type in to populate the repetitive text
* In `With` column, add the repetitive text that you want to populate when you type in the shortcut

# Reporting

## Integrated campaigns reporting

Marketing Programs uses Sisense dashboards to report on integrated campaigns performance, specifically:

1. [WIP: Integrated Campaigns Overview Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/631669/WIP:-Agnes-Oetama-IC-Dashboard): 
This dashboard provides quick insights on campaign performance and monitors the impacts of campaign optimizations on various funnel metrics over the life of the campaign.
2. [WIP: Integrated Campaigns Table Summary](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/665451/WIP:-Agnes-IC-Campaign-Table-Summary): This dashboard measures and compares the performance of integrated campaigns and channels within each campaign.

The Integrated Campaigns dashboards use [Bizible touchpoints](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible/#bizible-touchpoints) to track Inquiries, MQLs, and SDR Accepted metrics. We use the [Linear Bizible Attribution touchpoints model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible/#linear-attribution) to track Opportunities, Total IACV$, SAO, Pipeline IACV$, Won Deals count, and Won IACV $.

These dashboards were created by @aoetama and she is in the process of building out additional functionalities outlined in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/629). 

### Key Metrics tracked on the Integrated campaign dashboards

## Offer-Specific Dashboards

SFDC reports and dashboards to track program performance real-time. Data from the below SFDC reports/dashboards along with anecdotal feedback gathered during program retros will be used as guidelines for developing and growing various marketing programs.

The SFDC report/dashboard is currently grouped by program types so MPMs can easily compare and identify top performing and under performing programs within the areas that they are responsible for.

### Key Metrics tracked on ALL virtual events dashboards

*Note: Virtual Events include Webcast, Live Demos and Virtual Sponsorship*

* **Total Registration :** The number of people that registered for the virtual event regardless whether they attend or not.
* **Total Attendance:** The number of people that attended the LIVE virtual event (exclude people who watched the on-demand version).
* **Attendance Rate:** % of people that attended the LIVE virtual event out of the total registered (i.e: Total Attendance / Total Registration).
* **Net New Names:** The number of net new names added to our marketing database driven by the virtual event. Because a net new person record may be inserted into our CRM (SFDC) as a lead or a contact object therefore, we need to add `Total net new leads` and `Total net new contacts` to get the overall total net new names.
* **Influenced Pipe:** Total New and Add-on business pipeline IACV$ influenced by people who attended the LIVE virtual event. The webcast and live demo dashboards currently use SFDC out of the box `Campaigns with Influenced opportunities` report type because Bizible was implemented in June'18 and therefore the attribution report did not capture data prior to this. We plan to migrate webcast and live demo influenced pipe reports to Bizible attribution report in the next dashboard iteration so they align with overall marketing reporting.
