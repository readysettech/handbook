## Overview
This page focuses on content syndicatio through external vendors as a tactic used within marketing campaigns, including account centric campaigns. When employing this tactic, we have promoted our content through a third-party vendor, but do not direct the end users back to our website. In these cases, we often have given them the resource to make available for download to their audience, and recieve the leads to be uploaded.

### Process in GitLab to organize epic & issues

The project owner is responsible for following the steps below to create the epic and related issues in GitLab.

1. Project owner (FMM) creates the main tactic issue
1. Project owner (FMC) creates the epic to house all related issues (code below)
1. Project owner (FMC) creates the relevant issues required (shortcut links in epic code below)
1. Project owner (FMC) associates all the relevant issues to the newly created epic, as well as the original issue
1. Project owner (FMC) sets due dates for each issue, based on agreed upon SLAs between teams for each task, and confirms accurate ownership for each issue

*Note: if the date of the tactic changes, Project owner (FM) is responsible for changing the due dates of all related issues to match the new date, and alerting the team members involved.*
