## General leadership principles
This page will serve as a training resource and operational guide for current and future managers. All SDR Managers should follow the [general leadership
principles](/handbook/leadership/) set out in the handbook. 

- [1-1s](/handbook/leadership/1-1/)
- [Providing regular feedback](/handbook/leadership/#giving-feedback)
- [Dealing with underperformance](/handbook/underperformance/)

## Manager Onboarding
Onboarding is essential for all SDR Managers at GitLab. As part of onboarding, a [Becoming a GitLab Manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/Training/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/becoming-a-gitlab-manager.md) issue will be created for each manager when they join, or are promoted. This issue is intended to connect new managers with the crucial information they need, and ensure they have access to all the resources and training available.

## Onboarding
GitLab People Experience Associates will [create the onboarding issue](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/#timing) and start completing the onboarding tasks, no later than one week before the new team member joins. People Experience Associates require a minimum of 4 business days (with the new hire timezone as the basis) before the new hire's start date to complete all onboarding tasks. This issue will be automatically assigned to you. As a manager, you will [also have tasks](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/#managers-of-new-team-members) that need to be completed prior to the new team member's start date. 

The general onboarding issue will also automatically add a ['Sales Development' section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_tasks/department_sales_development.md) under 'Job Specific Tasks' based on the role of the new SDR. Both you and your new hire will have tasks to complete in this section. 

With the creation of this issue, an [access request (AR) will also be automatically created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_sales_development) for a new team member on their second day at GitLab. This AR lists the role based entitlements (pre-defined groups and system-level access that are granted automatically to team members depending on their role) your new hire will need.
     *See what is being auto provisioned on this AR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_demand_generation). 

### New Hire's First Day
On your new hire's first day, the assigned People Experience Associate will [schedule a welcome email](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/#day-1-onboarding-tasks) to arrive at 7:30am (local time of the new team member) on their start date detailing how your new hire can access GitLab and begin their onboarding process. 

### Manager Onboarding Checklist
##### Prior to Day 1
* Complete ‘Manager’ tasks on the onboarding issue *Note: there are tasks to complete prior to your new hire starting
* Schedule a welcome call at the start of your new hire’s first day to discuss:
     * Main focus should be completing as much of your onboarding as possible.
     * When you have available time feel free to move ahead as some onboarding task lists for the day won't take you all day.
     * How to manage meeting invites in your inbox (there are a ton!)
     * You will receive numerous emails in their first two weeks asking you to register or activate your license to a specific tool we use, please go ahead and do all of this.
     * What you can expect in regards to [onboarding at GitLab as an SDR](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/sdr-playbook-onboarding/)
    
##### After new hire has started

* Complete remaining ‘Manager’ tasks on the onboarding issue
* Set up [1:1s](/handbook/leadership/1-1/)

## Internal Team Transition
If an SDR or a group of SDRs will be moving from one SDR team to another, please open [this SDR internal transition template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sdr/-/issues/new?issuable_template=sdr_internal_team_change) as the automatic people ops issue does NOT get created for this type of transition. Please complete the steps in this issue to ensure the SDR changing teams has everything they need.

## Leave of Absence
If an SDR will be out for a prolonged period of time, please follow the proper processes and complete the SDR leave checklist.
- [Parental Leave](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave)
- [Emergency Situations](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-time-off-for-emergency-situations)
- [Unpaid leave](/handbook/paid-time-off/#unpaid-leave-of-absence)

### Manager SDR Leave Checklist
- Submit a [LeanData change request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=leandata_change_sdralignment) to ensure leads will be worked and Drift conversations will reroute to another member of your team during this time. In the additional information section detail the starting date and date of return. Try to give MktgOps a minimum of a weeks notice. 
- Work with your SDR to clean up tasks and mark sequences as finished or pause if needed. 

Similar to onboarding, there is a role-specific tasks section that will automatically be populated for the SDR team. This section includes tasks for the new manager and sales operations that must be filled out to ensure proper alignment, routing and reporting.  

## Offboarding
The full process for offboarding at GitLab differs based on whether it is voluntary or involuntary. These processes can be found on the [offboarding handbook page](/handbook/people-group/offboarding/#offboarding). 

### Manager Offboarding Checklist

* The people team will create an [offboarding issue](/handbook/people-group/offboarding/#offboarding), complete all ‘Manager’ tasks on the issue. If you have any questions use the #managers #peopleops slack channels. You can also reach out to the assigned people ops team member on the issue. 
* Create and submit an issue using [this issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=leandata_change_sdralignment) to inform Marketing Operations of who will be covering this territory and when that will start.
