## Welcome to the Social Marketing Handbook

_The social marketing team is responsible for the stewardship of the GitLab brand social channels. We‚Äôre accountable for the organic editorial calendar and work with partners across the community advocacy, digital marketing, talent brand, and other teams to orchestrate the social media landscape for GitLab._

**This page is the single source of truth for all strategies and positioning for the GitLab brand social channels.** If you're looking for administrative details (how-to open an issue, using labels, how to add frontmatter to your page for social sharing, etc.) [head to our Social Media Administration Handbook page](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/social-marketing/admin/).

## Social Media at GitLab has OKRs

Organic social media has a very particular way of succeeding. It's critical for the social team to lead the purpose and the OKRs that are focused on in order to align with best practices. While organic social media at GitLab may, at times, take requests from different teams with different objectives, it's important to remember that:

- it's more akin to storytelling than to direct marketing
- because our content goes worldwide and untargeted, organic social is top-of-funnel activity driving impressions, engagements, and conversations with assistance in link clicks to move users further down the funnel for the next team to work with
- the social team aids in corporate marketing OKRs as well as has our own to keep moving the practice at GitLab forward
- our long term goal is to continually make progress towards each of the above points

## Primary Social Channels, Audiences, and Calendaring <a name="primary social channels audiences and calendaring"></a>

| Channels under the care of the social team |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| [GitLab Brand Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitlab) |
| [GitLab Brand LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gitlab-com/) |
| [GitLab Brand Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gitlab) |
| [GitLab Brand Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gitlab/) |
| [GitLab Brand GIPHY Channel](https://giphy.com/gitlab) |

GitLab Branded Social Channels include our company [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitlab), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gitlab-com), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gitlab) which are managed in a more traditional manner. A potential [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gitlab) channel will take more of an editorial look at remote life and work at GitLab, this is currently on hold. A little less ‚Äúmarketing-y‚Äù and more about building community. Our [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gitlab) account is mainly for new GIF content, which can be tied to larger initiatives. And lastly, our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg) channel is a testament to the core of GitLab where everyone can contribute.

GIPHY does not appear in the channel list below at this time, mainly due to the ancillary function of the network.

### Twitter <a name="twitter"></a>

##### ‚úçÔ∏èChannel Use

Because the wider developer community utilizes [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitlab) as a platform to ask support questions, make feature suggestions, and share industry ideas, GitLab prioritizes this channel. We post to this platform first, and also more frequently. `@gitlab` broadcasts a variety of content including our blog, releases, important announcements, major integrated marketing campaigns, live event coverage, and All Remote content.

In addition to sharing curated content, the `@gitlab` Twitter handle participates in community management activities (likes, comments, and shares). Through this practice of engagement, we attempt to create a digital space for dev, friends and thought leadership.

Tweet threads should and are consistently used on the `@gitlab` Twitter handle. Because of GitLab‚Äôs value of transparency, utilizing Twitter threads gives our brand the opportunity to provide all important details without the character limit.

We ultimately use Twitter as an opportunity to provide our community with the most up to date information about gitlab.com, our brand, and also DevOps. We do that with a friendly voice because all devs are friends; no matter the tool they use. And we use emojis whenever we can. The overuse of emojis allows us to participate in a universally used language. GitLab believes that everyone can contribute. That‚Äôs why being better communicators is crucial for our audience- no message should go misunderstood.

##### üéØ Audience targets

From the United States to Japan, our Twitter audience is a global one. 66% of GitLab‚Äôs Twitter audience is between the ages of 18-24, and 16% are between the ages of 25-34. There is an equal breakdown of mobile device use between iOS and Android (both 50%). The nature of a developer‚Äôs job however still has 68% accessing Twitter from the web, not a mobile device. Twitter does not have the capability of breaking demographics down by title, however, our particular audience participates in the following conversations: DevOps, code, git, GitHub, remote and remote work, CI, and CD.

##### üìÖ Calendaring, Cadence, and Volume

How often GitLab should post depends on the platform and kind of content we are sharing. That said, Twitter does not operate like our other GitLab Social branded Channels. There are no strict frequency limitations on Twitter and we aim to post at least 3 times a day if not more. Content shared should prioritize the blog, releases, the hackathon, culture, the handbook, and All Remote content. These specific pages make up the majority of traffic driven from Twitter posts shared between October 2019-March 2020.

- If there are 4+ posts they should have at least 2 hours in between. This rule does NOT apply if there are time-sensitive posts including releases, security releases, patch releases, live event coverage, etc.
- Post every day, and utilize Sprout‚Äôs optimal time feature as we have many followers located across all time zones.
- But do not always select the 3-5 stars optimal time. If there are already 4 posts going out that day select the 1-2 stars optimal time. This will help keep the calendar properly spaced out and ensure we have content publishing throughout the day.
- In Twitter Media Studio, create Twitter cards when the meta description is irrelevant, not unique, or creating repetition. Media used must be delivered by the Design or Social Media Teams.
- Retweet daily mentions that are authored by Team Members, our community, our partners or are press opportunities. Retweets are not limited by frequency meaning there‚Äôs no limit at all! But there is an organized way which we do determine if something gets retweeted to the GitLab Branded Twitter. And it is up to the social media team‚Äôs discretion if a tweet gets shared.
    - **Milestones**: RT freely, or RT with a comment, emoji, or GIF when users are celebrating. These milestones can include but are not limited to: #MyFirstMRMerged, a number of MR‚Äôs, contributions, etc.
    - **Partner mentions**: Use the RT with comment feature and tag the socially active partner with their proper handle. Provide a short POV (point of view) on the partnership. Example: _@PartnerHandle + GitLab = purple heart_
    - **Press/third party mentions**: RT with comment _always_. Share gratitude with a clear CTA (call to action).

### Facebook

##### ‚úçÔ∏èChannel Use

GitLab has a smaller audience on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gitlab) so its priority does fall below Twitter and LinkedIn. It is still important to maintain our presence. That's why we aim to post to this platform no more than 2 posts per day (if that). GitLab should prioritize posts around All Remote, third party content, and our culture (or Life at GitLab). We do have an obligation to always post important announcements, releases, and specific campaigns or events.

##### üéØ Audience targets

From the United States to India, our Facebook audience is a global one. Although our Facebook audience does see 15% of its fan base from the United States. And 51% of fans between the ages of 25-34 are the leading force of followers. Through the power of organic reach, our content has a high potential to also reach users between the ages of 45-54.

Facebook does not have the capability of breaking demographics down by title, however our particular audience participates in the following conversations: security, code, remote, CI, cloud, and CD.

##### üìÖ Calendaring, Cadence, and Volume

How often GitLab should post depends on the platform and kind of content we are sharing. That said, Facebook does not operate like our other GitLab Social branded Channels. It is utilized less frequently and should prioritize culture culture, handbook, jobs, homepage, and All Remote content. These specific pages make up the majority of traffic driven from Facebook posts shared between October 2019-March 2020.

- There is no immediate need to post every single day on Facebook. Though, the social team will post once a day when content is available.
- There should not be more than 2 posts per day. And 2 posts per day on Facebook is used only during critical times. Critical times would mean there are timely updates, announcements, and or news that requires more than 2 posts on the GitLab Branded Facebook on a given day.

### LinkedIn <a name="linkedin"></a>

##### ‚úçÔ∏è Channel Use

Our company page on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gitlab-com) shares a variety of content including third party mentions, releases, our blog, company culture, major integrated marketing campaigns, events (must include geotargeting if applicable), and All Remote content. The repost feature of LinkedIn is then used to broadcast company mentions (Example: partner tags GitLab in their post-we broadcast that to our page). Ultimately we use LinkedIn as an opportunity to expand in more detail on the content that we care about. How do we do that? By using a variety of formatted posts with more text, bullets, emojis, questions, quotes, and/or even stats.

##### üéØ Audience targets

From San Francisco to India and in between, our LinkedIn audience views our company page from across the world. Our visitors fall primarily under senior (43.23%) and entry level (30.03%). GitLab‚Äôs LinkedIn audience is also lacking the CXO, Owner, VP, Manager and Director level followers. So we are able to make the assumption that it is GitLab end users who follow us on LinkedIn. The following industries make up this audience: IT + Services, Computer Software, Telecommunications, Financial Services, Higher Education, and Program Development.

##### üìÖ Calendaring, Cadence, and Volume

How often GitLab should post depends on the platform and kind of content we are sharing. That said, LinkedIn does not operate like Twitter and follows a 2-3 posts per day limit with the exception of timely announcements that must take place. Content shared should prioritize the home page, culture, the blog, hackathons and Heroes, Remote Work content, and the handbook. These specific pages make up the majority of traffic driven from LinkedIn posts shared between October 2019-March 2020.

- Post everyday, no more than a couple times a day- posting any more will result in a drop in engagement and cause GitLab posts to be hidden in followers‚Äô news feeds.
- Posts should have a few hours in between to avoid eating up our own impressions and engagements.
- Geotargeting through Sprout should **always** be used for events if applicable. For example, GitLab Connect in San Antonio, was limited by location factor=Texas. Using organic targeting like this allows us to provide followers relevant content.

## Other Social Channels, Audiences, and Calendaring <a name="other social channels audiences and calendaring"></a>

### Instagram

##### ‚úçÔ∏èChannel Use

In no way shape or form would our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gitlab) account mirror our other GitLab Branded Social Channels. In fact, it will take more of an editorial look, will be a little less ‚Äúmarketing-y‚Äù and be more about building community. We're rallying around a number of general topics. It does include remote work (All Remote), but more deeply about "Life at GitLab" (talent brand) and stories around living our values.
For remote specific content we will try and steer clear of remote working stereotypes as a dominant theme. The data and Remote Work Report says that reasons and lifestyles for remote are different for everyone - so really, that's the remote story we want to tell.

Instagram will help the Social Media team tell big stories with small moments. For example, corporate produced events like Commit can use Instagram to provide live experiences and video content.

##### üéØ Audience targets

This is essentially being treated as a net new social channel since it had never been posted to. There is no current data available on our audience. However, we intend for our Instagram content to be consumed by gitlabbers, prospective team members, gitlab.com users, and those interested in remote work. The GitLab Instagram is targeting the #LifeAtGitLab, #AllRemote, #RemoteLife, #OpenSource, #DevOps, and #FutureOfWork conversations.

##### üìÖ Calendaring, Cadence, and Volume

How often GitLab should post depends on the platform and kind of content we are sharing. That said, the Instagram Story feature will not have a frequency limitation and should be utilized as often as content is available. However, we will not over post Instagram wall posts. Instagram is a visual platform where GitLab can showcase the human side of our company and our brand. Each wall post on the GitLab Instagram account should tell its own story- and be a stand alone post. At initial launch, we will aim to post once a month as we gear up content to post 1X per week or biweekly

### Medium <a name="medium"></a>

GitLab has a [Medium publication](https://medium.com/gitlab-magazine), and all GitLab team-members may be added as writers! To be added as a writer to the publication, [import](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-post) a blog post that you authored on about.gitlab.com/blog to your personal Medium account, and submit it to the GitLab publication (by hitting `edit` -> `submit to publication` -> `GitLab Magazine`). the Social Marketing Manager will approve you as a writer and help finalize the post before publishing.

If you submit original content (i.e., not originally published somewhere else) to the publication for review, she may edit and publish your post. We want to highlight writers wherever possible, so we highly encourage you to import posts to your personal Medium.

**Content/Execution**

- Brand and thought leadership-focused
- Favorite articles about GitLab
- Aim to post one article to Medium every two weeks
- Cross-post our original thought-leadership posts to Medium, linking back to blog
    - Use the [import tool](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-post); do not copy and paste.

### YouTube <a name="youtube"></a>

**Content/Execution**

- Developer/community-focused
- Live events are more tech focused
    - Group Conversations, pick your brain meetings, demos, brainstorms, kickoffs

## Social Media's place in an integrated marketing and communications strategy

The social team does not create our own core messaging for blogs or campaigns. We take the approved messaging (whether it's in an issue, a sheet, or from the blog itself) and "socialize" it for our GitLab brand social channels. This is a critical step in making our content genuine, as it's best to take guidance approved upstream (content marketing, MPM, communications, etc.) to best align with our messages. Because of this, it's important to bring the social team into a campaign prior to being activated. It's also critical for our integrated teams to confirm that key messaging has been reviewed, if not approved, by stakeholders for the topic or practice we're promoting.

### Approval of copy

We understand that while social media posts being published is usually the last step in an integrated marketing or communications process, it's usually the first time that all eyes are able to see what came out of the work. Because of this, there are times that stakeholders might not see what messaging or creative made it through the social media creation process. To avoid this situation, we've adapted to a more formal approval process.

During the social media coverage issue request process, the social team adds copy suggestions to the issue for approval. For many integrated campaigns as well as times that just feel best to have an additiona layer of approval, we will request a formal approval prior to scheduling social posts in Sprout. This process does not exist for retweeting/sharing with comment, social-first activations, or blog updates (blogs are vetted through an editorial process that presents a company-approved blog to use copy as desired).

## Social-First content and campaigns

The social media team will often create our own content and mini-campaigns for the sake of having fun and meeting our own objectives. This is also a critical part of a successful content strategy. If our social-first content is to align with a larger topic or talking point from GitLab, we will be sure to run our messaging by the DRI on the correct team.

## Select social strategies that remain private due to the nature of the work

While we're public by default, there will always be strategies and details that will need to be confidential to the teams working together. These grey area details are often moved to confidential status on a subjective basis and for the security and protection of the greater community, partners or other 3rd-parties, and for disclosure reasons. For these reasons, the links below are to confidential issues or epics, which we'll use to retain information and act as confidential handbook pages when needed.

#### [Organic Social and Partner Marketing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/3154)

## Various Other Details

### Sharing 3rd-party events (onsite or virtual) on organic social where a team member is speaking

The purpose of GitLab team members participating in 3rd-party events is to bring GitLab's message to the 3rd-party's audience and to gain more community. Therefore, it's contradictory for GitLab brand social channels to promote a team member speaker for a 3rd-party event. Periodically, if the speaking engagement is part of a critical campaign or would resonate with the zietgiest of the moment, we may tweet once for folks to register for the event. However, if you're the speaker, we encourage you to post to your own social channels so that your network can join the event. Share your post with the #social_media Slack channel and we'll like, comment, and maybe share your post!

### Sharing blog posts

New blogs are linked in the #content-updates channel, and then our team simply uses that as a notification that the blog is ready to schedule and share on social. Sometimes when it‚Äôs connected to a campaign or is particularly important, we‚Äôll also get a ping about it in a thread from the original slack message.

If the blog is connected to an integrated campaign, it will be picked up in the social issues and epics for that campaign. If it is a part of a press release/announcement, we'll also be tagged in related issues through the PR workflow.

### Sharing "Unfiltered" blog posts or videos

GitLab Team Members are encouraged to write "unfiltered" posts, or blogs that do not go through an editorial process. This is an efficent way for folks from across the company to share ideas, hacks, stories, and more. However, because these blogs do not go through the traditional editorial process, we cannot promote them on our GitLab brand social channels. The editorial process is viewed as the bar to pass through in order for the company to support the writings we promote. The best way forward is to [follow the plan as laid out in the Unfiltered Handbook](/handbook/marketing/blog/unfiltered/#featured-posts). If you publish an Unfiltered post that you think could be a good fit for either the Editorial and PR teams, feel free to share it in the `#content` Slack channel. The social team does not own the approval of shifting blogs from Unfiltered through the editorial process and therefore cannot assist beyond this guidance.

## Social during a crisis

### Going Dark

In times of crisis, it may be appropriate for the social team to pause all brand channel social posts. This is called "going dark", and is a regular part of evaluating whether or not company messaging is appropriate to share at any given time. It is considered good practice to minimize the digital space brands occupy on social media during times of crisis. This can help to not distract social conversation but can also reduce the probability of being accidentally caught up in conversation unintentionally, sounding tone-deaf, or otherwise coming across as insensitive.

When this occurs, time-sensitive posts will be the first to be rescheduled. In the event time-sensitive posts could not be rescheduled, the social team will do what we can to update our stakeholders on what posts won't be published. Non-time sensitive posts will be moved to Sprout drafts, which can then be rescheduled at a later time.

Going dark could have a negative impact on social metrics, depending on the severity and length of time we're dark. Going dark could also negatively impact specific CTAs if we're relying on organic social to perform. These considerations are a part of making the decision and will be communicated as often as appropriate.

### Rewriting copy or switching assets

It may be necessary to update copy or assets depending on cultural impact during a crisis. The social team reserves the agency to do this as we see necessary, however, we will communicate the changes to our stakeholders if we'd consider the changes to be major.

### Default social channel bios and links

Sometimes bios and links will change on select social channels, depending on corporate level campaigns. This section keeps our default bios in a public place to restore when those campaigns are over. The links here are also UTM links, ensuring that we can better measure visits to our site from link in bio clicks.

| Channel | Bio | Link | When does the bio change? |
| ------- | --- | ---- | ------------------------- |
| Twitter | GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single application. Everyone can contribute. Follow @GitLabStatus for service information. | https://about.gitlab.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=bio | Corporate Level Campaigns |
| Instagram | GitLab is a complete #DevOps platform, delivered as a single application. An #AllRemote company in 60+ countries üåé Learn about #LifeAtGitLab ‚¨áÔ∏è | https://bit.ly/2vkcxI0 | Corporate Level Campaigns |
| Facebook | GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single application. There are 100,000 organizations using GitLab and we have an active community of 2,200+ code contributors. | https://bit.ly/2vVJDP8 | Rarely |
| LinkedIn | GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single application. We believe that everyone can contribute! | https://about.gitlab.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&utm_content=bio | Sometimes, talent brand campaigns |

### Responding as the company on LinkedIn for any post

Because of limited API access, it's challenging to engage and respond with posts on LinkedIn that do not directly @mention the company page. However, you can use the following method.

Every specific LinkedIn post from a page or a person has its own URL, [like this one](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wilspillane_open-source-social-media-strategies-from-activity-6674298269985767424-4SEx/). At the end of the URL, there is a string of characters at the end, like `6674298269985767424-4SEx/` from the example above. If you add the following to the end of the post URL when you are an admin of the GitLab LinkedIn page, you'll be able to engage and comment as GitLab.

`?actorCompanyId=5101804`

The URL example from earlier is
`https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wilspillane_open-source-social-media-strategies-from-activity-6674298269985767424-4SEx/`.

Adding the `actorCompanyId` to the url would look like
`https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wilspillane_open-source-social-media-strategies-from-activity-6674298269985767424-4SEx/?actorCompanyId=5101804`

This URL would allow for GitLab to comment and engage.

### Support and status communications on social media

For GitLab status updates, folks can find info at the [@gitlabstatus Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/gitlabstatus). This account is not managed by the social team.

Beyond general inquries and regular social engagement with our followers, we do not provide core support in private messages on social channels. We will instead direct followers to the [GitLab forums](https://forum.gitlab.com/) for support.

Please use a derivative of this message:

```
Thanks for reaching out! In our spirit of transparency, we don't provide support here. Please add your question to the Q&A section of the GitLab forum, so that everyone can learn the answer. https://forum.gitlab.com/c/questions-and-answers/7
```

_The above template is also located in Sprout for quick access_

The community advocacy team manages all inbound messages from users across digital channels and they support across social channels. To learn more about their work, [visit the Community Advocacy Handbook page](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-advocacy).
