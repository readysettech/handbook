## Customer reference program at GitLab

The goal of the Customer Reference Program is to provide opportunities for customers to share their story on how GitLab has helped them overcome the challenges, blockers and pain points within their organizations. The Reference Program Managers work as a conduit to help connect customers with opportunities by balancing customer requests with company demands. By providing a single point for outreach to customers, the CRP team prevents customer burnout, sales team burnout, and ensures a diversity of customer stories are shared publicly. 

## Who we are
Team of Experienced Customer Reference Professionals who are focused on building relationships within GitLab and with customers.  
The team gathers and builds information and relationships with the purpose of distilling these impactful insights into action. 

# Strategic driver of the Customer Reference Program
To manage our customer reference relationships like the precious resources they are to the maximum, quantified & qualified benefit for both customers and GitLab.

### Process for adding new reference customers

   3. CRM team is notified of nomination in SFDC, CRM creates a GitLab issue to manage the reference process
   4. If additional information is needed, CRM team will outreach to SAL (SAL may need to email and intro the CRM to customer)

### Customer Reference Request Rules of Engagement (Managing Volume & Frequency of Reference Customer Engagement Requests)
It is critical and the Customer Reference Management team’s responsibility to optimize our reference customer engagements to balance:
* Maximizing the positive impact of both the customer’s and GitLab’s investment of time and effort
* Ensuring continuous, long term customer and GitLab success by avoiding exhausting reference customer relationships<br>

By default, we will request a customer support reference call (sales/analyst relations/public relations) no more than once per quarter per customer. In support of event speaking and/or other participation support (field, alliance, digital, community, etc.), we will request customer support at a maximum of once every two quarters per customer. The CRM ultimately decides if the reference request is suitable for the proposed customer based on a number of factors including but not limited to:
* Past, current, and future planned volume
* Frequency
* Effort required of support requests
* Customer's stated comfortable volume and levels of engagement

### Creating new issue for Customer Reference Program
To create a new issue around the Customer Reference Program, open an issue on the [Customer Reference Program Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/boards/927283?&label_name[]=Customer%20Reference%20Program).
Make sure it has the label *Customer Reference Program*. Feel free to add any applicable labels around the request. Assign to Reference Program Manager as needed.

### Approved Customer Logos for promotion

      * Landscape before GitLab: Describe the challenges/business pains experienced with CI/CD and DevOps before adopting GitLab. What problems did the customer set out to solve?
      * Why GitLab: Explain customer's reasoning for selecting GitLab. Who else was considered and/or why did we stand out?
      * Results after implementing GitLab: Talk about the positive results with GitLab at a high level. This helps set the stage for more detailed, specific metrics / numbers that validate the results in the slide that comes next. 
      * Key benefits and Metrics from GitLab (align with value drivers/ use cases etc)
      * Future Plans with GitLab
    The above format is a proposed flow for the customer only; we welcome customers adding additional details (screenshots/graphic/images etc) to their presentation that reflects their success story to really make it their own. The CRM will work with the PMM to support the customer with messaging and content as required.
   2. The Event Manager supported by the CRM coordinates a maximum of 3 planning calls (including a dry run) with the customer to be respectful of everyone's time. The Event Manager schedules the planning and dry run calls in the calendars of all relevant parties as soon as feasible.<br> 
      * The Event Managers act as the DRI to facilitate these calls, set the agenda, and ensure the process goes smoothly.<br>  
      * The CRM is the DRI for customer content creation only, not the overall event.<br>  
      * The CRM is optional to attend the dry run and the actual event as by then the customer content requirement has been delivered.<br>  
      * The CRM also helps coordinate between the customer and GitLab team members collaborating on the content.
