# The Market Viewpoint

## Simplify DevOps

The Simplify DevOps usecase is applicable for customers who are aware of the efficiencies to be gained by end to end DevOps but have not been able to achieve expected results due to a hodge podge of tools and integrations, siloed teams, cultural misalignment, lack of visibility and/or collaboration. In such scenarios, the **GitLab value of a single application** from idea to production inclusive of monitoring and security is appealing to the customer.  

The [worldwide DevOps market](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4856237/devops-market-global-industry-trends-share) is expected to grow with a **growth rate of 20 percent** from $3.5 Bn in 2018 to **$10.5 Bn in 2024**. Increasing adoption of agile frameworks, cloud technologies, and digitization of enterprises to automate business processes are driving the growth.


## Personas

### User Persona
Since there is a requirement for end of end DevOps improvements, the typical **user persona** for this usecase is [Devon - the DevOps Engineer](/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer). The key motivations for such a persona are:
- DevOps Engineers manage multiple different teams with varied needs. The motivation for Simplifying DevOps is to have a consistent and efficient development experience that is scalable with single source of truth and a shared view for collaboration to be able to support multiple teams.
- DevOps Engineers are frequently pulled in during crisis situations. The motivation for Simplifying DevOps is to test early, enforce common controls like single sign on and security processes as well as approvals to minimize post production issues.

### Buyer Personas
End to end DevOps requirements typically involve executive involvement - VP of DevOps, VP of Engineering, VP of Innovation and above.

## Proof Points - customers

### Quotes and reviews
<List of customer quotes/reviews from public sites>

### Case Studies
* [BI Worldwide](/customers/bi_worldwide/) removed technology barriers to focus on building microservices.
> One tool for SCM+CI/CD was a big initial win. Now wrapping security scans into that tool as well has already increased our visibility into security vulnerabilities. The integrated Docker registry has also been very helpful for us. Issue/Product management features let everyone operate in the same space regardless of role.
>
> Adam Dehnel, Product Architect, BI Worldwide

* [Glympse](/customers/glympse/) consolidated ~20 tools consolidated into GitLab and remediated security issues faster than any other company in their Security Auditor's experience
>Development can move much faster when engineers can stay on one page and click buttons to release auditable changes to production and have easy rollbacks; everything is much more streamlined. Within one sprint, just 2 weeks, Glympse was able to implement security jobs across all of their repositories using GitLab’s CI templates and their pre-existing Docker-based deployment scripts.
>
>Zaq Wiedmann, Lead Software Engineer, Glympse

* [Goldman Sachs](/customers/goldman-sachs/) improves from bi-monthly builds to over a thousand per day
> GitLab has allowed us to dramatically increase the velocity of development in our Engineering Division. We believe GitLab’s dedication to helping enterprises rapidly and effectively bring software to market will help other companies achieve the same sort of efficiencies we have seen inside Goldman Sachs. We now see some teams running and merging 1000+ CI feature branch builds a day!

> Andrew Knight, Managing Director, Goldman Sachs
