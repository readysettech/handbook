### What does Strategic Marketing do at GitLab

  Strategic marketing is GitLab's interface to the market. The market is made up of customers, analysts, press, thought leaders, competitors, etc. Strategic marketing enables other GitLab teams such as Sales, Marketing, and Channel with narrative, positioning, messaging, and go-to-market strategy to go outbound to the market. Strategic marketing does market research to gather customer knowledge, analyst views, market landscapes, and competitor intelligence providing marketing insights inbound to the rest of GitLab.

#### Use case Go To Market
##### [Why use case driven GTM?](/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/usecase-gtm/)

##### Use case based messaging
  The Strategic Marketing team also develops messaging and collaterals that aligns with a buyer's needs and a journey with GitLab supporting those needs. For example, a customer with a specific problem of SCM does not need to be sold the value of the single application. Rather these use case based messaging and collaterals will help when talking to customers to address their specific pain points.
