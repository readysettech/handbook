## Types of partners that Partner Marketing supports

**Technology Partners**

1. Alliances partners - These are partnerships we have that are strategic in nature and we partner with them to generate pipeline. Examples include: AWS, Google Cloud, Red Hat, and VMware

1. Eco-partners or integration partners - These are much smaller partnerships that we may or may not have an official partnership agreement in place. But they all have some sort of product integration with GitLab.  An example of a strong eco-partner is HashiCorp

**Channel Partners**

1. Definitions of types of channel partners are [here ](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/channel/#channels-partner-types)


## Who are we

Partner Marketing (includes both technology partners and channel partners) is the single connection point from alliances and channel to PMM, PM, FMM, corporate events, digital marketing and marketing programs. We ensure joint partner/channel messaging, joint value proposition and focus on the current and future scope for both organizations. Our main goal is to leverage our strategic partners to increase awareness of GitLab while increasing joint sales for our enterprise users.

This page will cover all of Technology Partner Marketing. If you need information for Channel Partner Marketing, [click here](/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/analyst-relations/channel-marketing/).
