## What is the Gitaly team?

The Gitaly team is responsible for building and maintaining systems to ensure
that the git data storage tier of GitLab instances, and _GitLab.com in particular_,
is fast. Gitaly migrated GitLab.com away from NFS, and is now working on a
highly available Git storage layer.

## Mission

Provide a durable, performant, and reliable Git storage layer for GitLab.

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Gitaly Team:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Backend Engineering Manager, Gitaly') %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[&,] Create:Gitaly/, direct_manager_role: 'Backend Engineering Manager, Gitaly') %>

## How we work

In general, we use the standard GitLab [engineering workflow]. To get in touch
with the Create:Gitaly team, it's best to create an issue on the [Gitaly issue tracker]
and add the `~"group::gitaly"` label, along with any other appropriate labels.
Then, feel free to ping the relevant Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager
as listed above.

For more urgent items, feel free to use [#g_create_gitaly] on Slack.

### Working with product

A weekly call is held between the product manager and engineering manager,
which is listed in the "Gitaly Team" calendar. Everyone is welcome to join and
these calls are used to discuss any roadblocks, concerns, status updates,
deliverables, or other thoughts that impact the group.


### Capacity planning

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/capacity_planning.erb") %>

### Retrospectives

At the beginning of each release, the Gitaly EM will create a retrospective issue
to collect discussion items during the release. The first weekly Gitaly meeting
after the 18th that issue will be used to discuss what was brought up.

Additionally, a weekly review is conducted by the Geekbot Slack integration. Each
member of the `#gitaly-standup` channel on Slack will be prompted to fill out the
weekly retrospective to review what you've learned and what can be improved.

### Onboarding

When a new developer joins Gitaly, their resposibility will include maintaining
the Gitaly project from their first day. This means that the developer will get
`Maintainer` access to the repository and will be added to the
`gitlab.com/gl-gitaly` group so they appear in merge request approval group.

### Career development

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/career_development.erb", locals: { group: "Gitaly" }) %>

### Offboarding

Maintainer rights are revoked, and to remove the developer from the list of
authorized approvers, remove them from the `gl-gitaly` GitLab.com group.
