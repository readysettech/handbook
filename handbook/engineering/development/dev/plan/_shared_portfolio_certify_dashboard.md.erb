Since we share a backend team between the Plan:Portfolio Management and Certify
groups, we have a [combined metrics dashboard][dashboard]. This is intended to
track against some of the [Development Department KPIs][kpis], particularly
those around merge request creation and acceptance. From that dashboard, the
following charts show [MR Rate] and
[Mean time to merge (MTTM)] respectively.

<%= team_mr_rate_chart(team_id: 'plan_portfolio_management_be', html_options: { width: '49.7%', height: '300' }) %>
<%= team_mean_time_to_merge_chart(team_id: 'plan_portfolio_management_be', html_options: { width: '49.7%', height: '300' }) %>


The following chart shows a breakdown of MRs by category (omitting Security, for
now). Totals may vary slightly from overall throughput as some MRs may have more
than one throughput label.
<%= team_mr_categories_chart(team_id: 'plan_portfolio_management_be') %>
