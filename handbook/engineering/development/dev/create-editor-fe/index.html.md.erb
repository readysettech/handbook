### Web IDE technical direction

If you are a frontend engineer and you are working on the Web IDE code, please consider the following questions:

- **Are you touching the `file` state object?** - Please visit [Web IDE: Move properties away from the file object](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3587) epic and see if you can move away some properties.
- **Are you touching the state management?** (e.g. editor, project, file, trees) - Please see if you could chip away some of the [Web IDE state redesign](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3578)
