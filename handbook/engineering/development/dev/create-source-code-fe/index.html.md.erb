## Iteration

We held an Iteration Retrospective in April 2020 in order to review past work and discuss how we could improve iteration for upcoming efforts.

* [Frontend: Iteration Retrospective (Source Code)](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/create-stage/source-code/-/issues/22)

Some overal conclusions/improvements
* Despite having improved the splitting of Merge Requests, we still tend to keep one issue spawning multiple Merge Requests.
* We'll be more strict about splitting the issues in foreseeable iteration steps upon scheduling/assignment
* We must keep in mind the overhead in review times when splitting up related backstage work. ([more info](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/create-stage/source-code/-/issues/22#note_342547093))
