## Vision

Developing solutions for scalability, application performance, data growth and developer enablement especially where it concerns interactions with the database.

## Mission

Focusing on the database, our mission is to provide solutions that allow us to scale to our customer's demands.  To provide tooling to proactively identify performance bottlenecks to inform developers early in the development lifecycle.  To increase the number of database maintainers and provide database best practices to the community contributors and development teams within GitLab.

The following people are permanent members of the Database Group:

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Database Group:

<%-# Hard coding the team makeup for now until team.yml reflects the team structure -%>
<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Backend Engineering Manager, Database') %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Database/, direct_manager_role: 'Backend Engineering Manager, Database') %>

## Meetings

Whenever possible, we prefer to communicate asynchronously using issues, merge requests, and Slack. However, face-to-face meetings are useful to establish personal connection and to address items that would be more efficiently discussed synchronously such as blockers.

* Database Group Office Hours every Tuesday and Thursday at 1:00 PM UTC
  * Tuesdays - first 30 minutes dedicated to team weekly topics
  * Thursdays - the first Thursday after milestone close is dedicated to the milestone retro

## Work

We follow the GitLab [engineering workflow](/handbook/engineering/workflow/) guidelines.  To bring an issue to our attention please create an issue in the relevant project.  Add the `~"group::database"` label along with any other relevant labels.  If it is an urgent issue, please reach out to the Product Manager or Engineering Manager listed in the [Stable Counterparts](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/database/#stable-counterparts) section above.

### What we do

The team is responsible for the PostgreSQL application interactions to enable high performance queries while offering features to support scalability and strengthen availability. For the foreseeable future, the team will be focusing on database partitioning and sharding. PostgreSQL is the heart of Rails application, and there is no shortage of work to make GitLab more performant, scalable, and highly available from database perspective.

### Planning
We use a [planning issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/database-team/team-tasks/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Planning.md) to discuss priorities and commitments for the milestone.  This happens largely asynchronously, but when we do need to discuss synchronously we discuss during the Tuesday team [meeting](#meetings) timeslot.

#### Say/Do Ratio
We use the `~Deliverable` label to track our Say/Do ratio.  At the beginning of each milestone, during a Database Group Weekly meeting, we review the issues and determine those issues we are confident we can deliver within the milestone.  The issue will be marked with the `~Deliverable` label.  At the end of the milestone the successfully completed issues with the `~Deliverable` label are tracked in two places.  We have a dashboard in Sisense that will calculate how many were delivered within the mileston and account for issues that were moved.  Additionally, our milestone retro issue lists all of the `~Deliverable` issues shipped along with those that missed the milesone.

#### Roadmap
The Database Group [Roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Roadmap&label_name[]=group%3A%3Adatabase) gives a view of what is currently in flight as well as projects that have been prioritized for the next 3+ months.


### Boards

- [Database by Milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1318796?&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Adatabase)
  - The main board used for planning and prioritization. Issues are placed into milestones and in priority order from top to bottom. When looking for work, team members should choose the topmost item from this list that is unassigned.
- [Database:Workflow Kanban](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1324138?label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Adatabase)
  - Reflects the current state of the issue (Open, Ready for Development, In Dev, In Review, Blocked, Closed).
- [Database:Planning](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1324141?&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Adatabase)
  - A view of issues grouped by Priority or Severity.
