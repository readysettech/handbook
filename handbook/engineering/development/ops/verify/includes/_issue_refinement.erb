Issues are refined and weighted prior to scheduling them to an upcoming milestone. We use `candidate::` scoped labels to help with planning work in future iterations. The additional label allows us to filter on the issues we are planning, allowing Product, Engineering and UX to [start async issue refinement on the 4th](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline).  Weighting also helps with capacity planning with respect to how issues are scheduled in future milestones. 

We create 2 issues as part of our Planning process:
 1. Planning issue - Product is the DRI in scheduling work, with input from Engineering, UX and Technical Writers. This issue is used to discuss scheduling and team capacity. We use an issue list filtered on `~group::pipeline authoring` and `candidate::x.y`.
 1. Needs Weight issue - Engineering is the DRI in ensuring issues are refined asynchronously and weighted accordingly, given what is planned for the milestone. This helps Product understand how much can be scheduled in the future milestone(s), once the complexity and effort of the issues are better understood.  For example, issues may need to be broken down if they are too large for a milestone, or further research may be necessary, so subsequent issues or epics can be created.

Both issues currently rely on the `candidate::` scoped label to determine what issues are to be investigated for the upcoming milestone(s).
