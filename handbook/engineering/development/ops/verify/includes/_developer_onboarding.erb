Welcome to the team! Whether you're transferring internally or joining GitLab as a new hire, you'll be assigned an [onboarding buddy](/handbook/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/). If you are an internal transfer, your manager will appoint you an onboarding buddy so you can have someone to work with as you're getting familiarized with our codebase, our tech stack and the team.

Read over this page as a starting point, and feel free to set up regular sync or async conversations with your buddy. It's also recommended to schedule a few coffee chats to meet some members of our team. Your manager may optionally create an onboarding checklist for you to go through if it's helpful.

In the our list of issues, there are also ones with an `~onboarding` label that are smaller issues to onboard onto the product. If there aren't any in the current **Workflow issue board** to work on, reach out to your EM/PM to see which issues you can work on as part of your onboarding period.
