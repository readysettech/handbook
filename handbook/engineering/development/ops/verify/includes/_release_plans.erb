To encourage more transparency and collaboration amongst the team and additionally align on the [Release Posts](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/) we publish at the end of each milestone, we will be creating a separate issue to highlight a **Feature flag roll out plan** for each feature being released starting in 13.2, based on the [issue template for feature flag roll outs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20Flag%20Roll%20Out.md). The engineer who implements the feature will be responsible for creating this separate issue to highlight the details of when and how the feature flag will be toggled, and subsquently link this issue to their feature issue.  The product manager will tag this issue as a blocker to their release post, so that everyone is aligned on the release plan of the feature.
