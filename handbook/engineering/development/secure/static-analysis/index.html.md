## Static Analysis

The Static Analysis group at GitLab is charged with developing solutions which perform [Static Analysis Software Testing (SAST)](/direction/secure/static-analysis/sast/),

[Secrect Detection](/direction/secure/static-analysis/secret-detection/), and [Malware Detection](/direction/secure/#malware-scanning) for customer software repositories.

## How We Work

The Static Analysis group largely follows GitLab's [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) as well as
[Secure's interpretation of this workflow](/handbook/engineering/development/secure/workflow/).

### Product Prioritization Labels

We also use additional labels to categorize different types of requests. These labels represent the top areas of product impact we are currently focused on within the Static Analysis team.

### Community Contributions

The Static Analysis group is actively reserving capacity each iteration to be responsive to MRs
from the community. Each backend engineer in the group will serve as the [Community Merge Request Coach](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/) on a rotating basis. The Community Merge Request Coach has the following responsibilities, in priority order:

1. Triage and work with community contributors to help drive their MRs to completion.
1. Release feature(s) to core.
1. Triage and resolve ~priority::1 bugs.
1. Work an issue in the backlog that's of great interest to you.
