## Welcome to the Fulfillment Group Page

### Who are we and what do we work on?

The Fulfillment team is responsible for the infrastructure between the systems which affect the user purchasing process, as well as being the primary caretakers of the Subscriptions App and the License App.

Since we overlap with the other groups in the [Growth Stage](/handbook/product/product-categories/#growth-stage) it can be hard to determine, who to go to for what. The other Growth groups focus on features, enhancements, experiments and pushing adoption and retention forward. We (Fulfillment) focus on keeping everything up and running, in other words, keeping the lights on. :high_brightness:

We frequently collaborate with other teams. For example if we are making a change which will affect [usage ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/usage_statistics.html#usage-ping) we collaborate with the [Telemetry group](/handbook/product/product-categories/#telemetry-group). When our work involves or affects any backend enterprise application, we collaborate with the [Sales Systems team](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-systems/).

## Improving the purchase, renewal, and licensing flows.

The Fulfillment team is currently working on an initiative to improve our sales efficiency. We're following the [Engineering Demo Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#engineering-demo-process) in order to show regular improvements as we iterate on issues in this area.

Our [Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DVUSg6ow5eT9UcG56KwF5uu0MIWf2jo_21XyDxgUOuo/edit#gid=0) (internal only) breaks down the different steps in these flows and links to videos where we step through the process and discuss the issues that aim to improve them.

## Software architecture

We follow the [GitLab architecture guide and practices](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/architecture/) and discuss architecture matters in #g_fulfillment_architecture on Slack.

The Subcriptions App provides APIs which allow the purchase experience to happen within GitLab itself.
