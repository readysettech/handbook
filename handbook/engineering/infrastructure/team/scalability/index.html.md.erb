## Mission

The **Scalability team** is responsible for GitLab and GitLab.com at scale,
working on the highest priority scalability items in the application in close
coordination with **Reliability Engineering** teams and providing feedback
to other Engineering teams so they can become better at scalability as well.

## Vision

As its name implies, the Scalability team enhances the **availability**,
**reliability** and, **performance** of GitLab by observing the application's
capabilities to operate at GitLab.com scale.
The **Scalability team** analyzes application performance on GitLab.com,
recognizes bottlenecks in service availability, proposes short term improvements
and develops long term plans that help drive the decisions of other Engineering teams.

Short term goals include:

- Refine existing, define new, and document [Service Level Objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective)
for each of GitLab's services.
- Continuously expose the top 3 critical bottlenecks that threaten the stability of
GitLab.com.
- Work on scoping, planning and defining the implementation steps of the top critical
bottleneck.
- Define and track team KPI's to track impact on GitLab.com and GitLab as an
application.

## Indicators

The Infrastructure Department is concerned with the [availability](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/performance-indicators/#gitlabcom-availability)
and [performance](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/performance-indicators/#gitlab-com-performance) of GitLab.com.

GitLab.com's service level availability is visible on the [SLA Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/dashboards-gitlab-com/-/environments/1790496/metrics?dashboard=.gitlab%2Fdashboards%2Fsla-dashboard.yml&duration_seconds=2592000),
and we use the [General GitLab Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/general-public-splashscreen/general-gitlab-dashboards)
in Grafana to observe the service level indicators (SLIs) of apdex, error ratios, requests per second, and saturation of the services.

These dashboards show lagging indicators for how the services have responded to the demand generated by the application.

### Application Demand

We have a leading indicator of application demand. This is shown on the [Application Demand Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/general-application-demand).

Application demand is used as a way to identify that there may have been an application level change that alters how
the application makes requests of the underlying infrastructure. If we observe a change in rate, this tells us that we
need to investigate and understand the cause of the change.

### Tracking towards our goals

We use indicators to track towards our goals. More information can be found on our [goals page](./goals.html).

## Team Members

The following people are members of the Scalability Team:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Engineering Manager, Scalability')%>

## Team counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Scalability/, direct_manager_role: 'Engineering Manager, Scalability') %>

We work with all engineering teams across all departments as a representative of GitLab.com as one of the largest
GitLab installations, to ensure that GitLab continues to scale in a safe and sustainable way.

[The Memory team](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/memory/) is a natural counterpart to the Scalability
team, but their missions are complementing each other rather than overlap:

| Scalability Team | Memory Team |
| ---              | ---         |
| Focused on GitLab.com first, self-managed only when necessary. | Focused on resolving application bottlenecks for all types of GitLab installations. |
| Driven by set SLO objectives, regardless of the nature of the issue. | Focused on application performance and resource consumption, in all environments. |
| Primary concern is preventing disruptions of GitLab.com SLO objectives through changes in the application architecture.| Primary concern is managing the application performance for all types of GitLab installations. |

Simply put:

- The Scalability team is focused on all work that affects GitLab.com SLOs.
- The Memory team is focused on general GitLab resource consumption and performance.

## How do I engage with the Scalability Team?

1. Start with an issue in the Scalability team tracker: [Create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/issues/new).
1. You are welcome to follow this up with a Slack message in [#g_scalability](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_scalability).
1. Please don't add any `workflow` labels to the issue. The team will triage the issue and apply these.

### Scalability review requests

If you're working on a feature that has specific scaling requirements, you
can create an issue with the [review request
template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Review%20Request).
Some examples are:

1. [Review Request - Impact on database load for enabling advanced global search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/377)
1. [Review Request - Assumptions about build prerequisite-related application limits](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/421)
1. [Review Request - Throttling for Cleanup Policies Scaling Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/461)

This template gives the Scalability team the information we need to help you, and the issue will be shown on
our [build board](#issue-boards) with a high priority.

A few weeks after a review has been closed, a follow-up comment is added to ask for feedback in a survey. This helps
us understand if the process has been helpful and if there are improvements that can be made. We [go through the
feedback provided in the surveys](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/524) each quarter.

This process is an example of [doing something that doesn't
scale](/handbook/values/#do-things-that-dont-scale); as we do more of these,
we'll learn what topics can be covered more efficiently by training,
documentation, and tooling.

## How does the Scalability Team engage with Stage Groups?

When we observe a situation on GitLab.com that needs to be addressed alongside a stage group, we first raise an issue
in the Scalability issue tracker that describes what we are seeing. We try to determine if the problem lies with the action
the code is performing, or the way in which it is running on GitLab.com. For example, with queues and workers, we will see
if the problem is in what the queue does, or how the worker should run.

If we find that the problem is in what the code is doing, then we engage with the EM/PM of that group to find the right path
forward. If work is required from that group, we will create a new issue in the gitlab-org project and use the [Availability
and Performance Refinement process](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#process-1) to highlight this issue.

## How we work

### Meetings and Scheduled Calls

We prefer to work asynchronously as far as possible but still use synchronous communication where it makes sense to do so.

To that end, we have very few scheduled calls.

- Weekly on Fridays we have a demo call. The purpose of this call is to showcase something that you have been working on
during that week. It does not have to be perfect or polished. Items should be added to the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13TW4x3ofw0RxifZvZ7eNvrPxFnnXmhzQ8fal3fhYgjg/edit#) 24 hours ahead of the meeting.
If there are no agenda items at that time, the call is cancelled for that week. A [playlist of the recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kphnnvtz9CDatQAVGs_q2Cv) is available on GitLab Unfiltered.
- Monthly (in the second week of a month) we have a social call. The purpose of this call is to catch up with each other and calls
may be themed to start the conversation. These are set up as double-calls, where there are two calls booked to suit people in
all time zones. The intention is for everyone to attend at least one call, but to please join both if possible. Since this is
only done monthly, this should hopefully not be too much of a burden to take a call at an unusual hour.

Lastly, in order to keep people connected, team members schedule at least one coffee-chat with another team member each
week. These are at times that will best suit them as it may be an unusual hour given the various timezones and working hours for each person.

### Project Management

We use Epics, Issues, and Issue Boards to organize our work, as they complement each other.

The single source of truth for all work is [Scaling GitLab.com epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/148).
This is considered as the top-level epic from which all other epics are derived.

Epics that are added as children to the top-level epic are used to describe projects that the team undertakes.

Having all projects at this level allows us to use a single list for prioritization and enables us to prioritize
work for different services alongside each other. Projects are prioritized in line with the OKRs for the current quarter.

Project status is maintained in the description of the top-level epic so that it is visible at a glance. This is auto-generated.
You can watch a [short demo of this process](https://youtu.be/6Wb1f-c1_og) to see how to use status labels
on the epics to make use of this automation.

Example organization is shown on the diagram below:

```mermaid
graph LR
	A[Scaling GitLab.com] --> B(Add observability metrics to Service X)
  A --> C(Queue Z is not meeting its SLI)
  A --> D(Embed Scalability into Development practises)
  D --> E(Automate alerting into stage group channels)
  D --> F(Create development tutorial sets)
  A --> G(Add profiling to Go Services)
  A --> H(Make sidekiq jobs idempotent)

```

#### Project Structure

The epic for the project must have the following items:

1. **Background**, including a problem statement, to provide context for people looking to understand the project.
1. **Exit criteria** for the specific goals of the project.
    1. These are created as issues with the `exit criterion` label in the epic and are linked in the description.
    1. We create these at the start of the project to allow us to keep focused on our goal, and use [blocking issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/related_issues.html) to indicate the state of each exit criterion.
1. **Status yyyy-mm-dd** should be the final heading in the description.
    1. This enables others who are interested in the epic to see the latest status without having to read through all comments or issues attached to the epic.
    1. This heading is used to auto-genetate the status information on the top-level epic.
1. **Start date** is set to the expected start date, and updated to be the actual start date when the project begins.
1. **Due date** is set to be the expected end date.
    1. This should be seen as a target, and this target is re-evaluated every few weeks while the project is in progress. The date that a project actually ended is taken from the date that the epic was closed.

### Issue boards

The Scalability team [issue boards](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/boards/) track
the progress of ongoing work.

On the **planning board**, the goal is to get issues into a state where we have enough information to build the issue.
However, not all issues that are `workflow-infra::Ready` to be built should be scheduled for development right away. Some
issues may be too big, or have too low a priority. This means not all issues that are `workflow-infra::Ready` on the
planning board will move to the build board immediately.

Please see the [triage rotation section](#triage-rotation) for when to move issues between the boards.

| **Planning** | **Building**|
|--------------|-------------|
| [Planning Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/boards/1697168) | [Build Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/boards/1697160) |
| Issues where we are investigating the work to be done. | Issues that will be built next, or are actively in development. |
| ![Triage](img/label-triage.png)	<br/>![Proposal](img/label-proposal.png) <br/>![Ready](img/label-ready.png) | ![Ready](img/label-ready.png) <br/>![In Progress](img/label-in_progress.png) <br/>![Under Review](img/label-under_review.png) <br/>![Verify](img/label-verify.png) <br/>![Done](img/label-done.png)|

### Labels

The Scalability team routinely uses the following set of labels:

1. The team label, `team::Scalability`.
1. Priority labels `Scalability::`.
1. Scoped `workflow-infra` labels.
1. Scoped `Service` labels.

The `team::Scalability` label is used in order to allow for easier filtering of
issues applicable to the team that have group level labels applied.

<a name="priority-labels">The priority labels</a> allow us to track the issues correctly and raise/lower priority of work based on both external and internal factors.

This means that the highest priority is given to working on issues that improve
Gitlab.com SLO's either immediately and directly, or by unblocking other issues
to achieve the same.

#### Workflow labels

The Scalability team leverages scoped workflow labels to track different stages of work.
They show the progression of work for each issue and allow us to remove blockers or change
focus more easily.

The standard progression of workflow is from top to bottom in the table below:

| State Label | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![Triage](img/label-triage.png) | Problem is identified and effort is needed to determine the correct action or work required. |
| ![Proposal](img/label-proposal.png) | Proposal is created and put forward for review. <br/>SRE looks for clarification and writes up a rough high-level execution plan if required. SRE highlights what they will check and along with soak/review time and developers can confirm. <br/>If there are no further questions or blockers, the issue can be moved into "Ready". |
| ![Ready](img/label-ready.png) | Proposal is complete and the issue is waiting to be picked up for work. |
| ![In Progress](img/label-in_progress.png) | Issue is assigned and work has started. <br/>While in progress, the issue should be updated to include steps for verification that will be followed at a later stage.|
| ![Under Review](img/label-under_review.png) | Issue has an MR in review. |
| ![Verify](img/label-verify.png) | MR was merged and we are waiting to see the impact of the change to confirm that the initial problem is resolved. |
| ![Done](img/label-done.png) | Issue is updated with the latest graphs and measurements, this label is applied and issue can be closed. |

There are three other workflow labels of importance:

| State Label | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![Cancelled](img/label-cancelled.png) | Work in the issue is being abandoned due to external factors or decision to not resolve the issue. After applying this label, issue will be closed. |
| ![Stalled](img/label-stalled.png) | Work is not abandoned but other work has higher priority. After applying this label, team Engineering Manager is mentioned in the issue to either change the priority or find more help. |
| ![Blocked](img/label-blocked.png) | Work is blocked due external dependencies or other external factors. Where possible, a [blocking issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/related_issues.html) should also be set. After applying this label, issue will be regularly triaged by the team until the label can be removed. |


#### Priority labels

The Scalability team uses priority labels as a means to indicate order under which work is next to be picked up. Priorities are roughly defined as:

| Priority level  | Definition |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Scalability::P1 | Issue is blocking other team-members, or blocking other work.  As soon as possible after completing ongoing task unless directly communicated otherwise. |
| Scalability::P2 | Issue has a large impact, or will create additional work. |
| Scalability::P3 | Issue should be completed once other urgent work is done. |
| Scalability::P4 | **Default priority**. A nice-to-have improvement, non-blocking technical debt, or a discussion issue. |

#### Labels in gitlab-org group

Stage groups use [throughput labels](/handbook/engineering/management/throughput/) to label merge requests in projects in the `gitlab-org` group. The Scalability team is not a part of the stage groups, and labels of importance for the team are explained above. When submitting work in gitlab-org group, we apply ~"team::Scalability" and ~"feature::maintenance" to merge requests by default. The latter label is describing work towards refinement of existing functionality which describes majority of the work the team is contributing.

### Triage rotation

We have automated triage policies defined in the [triage-ops
project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/triage-ops). These
perform tasks such as automatically labelling issues, asking the author
to add labels, and creating weekly triage issues.

We rotate the triage ownership each month, with the current triage owner
responsible for picking the next one (a reminder is added to their last
triage issue).

There are three issues created weekly:

1. **Board refinement**
   1. Using the [Planning Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/boards/1697168).
      1. `workflow-infra::Triage` issues should be checked to make sure the idea is valid. Move the conversation forward
          and ask for clarification where needed. Do what you can to add more details to develop a proposal.
      1. `workflow-infra::Proposal` issues should be checked to make sure that the proposal is complete. The benefit of the
          work should be clear, it should contain a breakdown of tasks, and include steps to validate the outcome.
      1. `workflow-infra::Blocked` issues should be checked to see if blockers have been removed.
      1. `workflow-infra::Ready` issues should be moved to the [Build Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/boards/1697160) using the following guidelines:
          1. _Issue part of an active project_ - then move it to the build board, else
          1. _Issue part of a future project_ - then move it back to the backlog, else
          1. _Issue is `Scalability::P1` or `Scalability::P2`_ - then move it to the build board, else
          1. _Other issue that is less than 2 days of work_ - then move to the build board, else
          1. _Other issue that is larger than 2 days of work_ - raise with the Engineering Manager or discuss in the team's Slack channel.
2. **`Service::Unknown` refinement** - go through issues marked `Service::Unknown` and add a defined service, where possible.
3. **Review request processing** - the goal is to move [review request](#scalability-review-requests) issues to `workflow-infra::In Progress`, either
   through picking them up directly, or asking on our team channel if any one else is able.

## Choosing something to work on

We work from our main epic: [Scaling GitLab on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/148).

Most of our work happens on the current in-progress sub epic. This is always prominently visible from the main
epic's description.

When choosing something new to work on you can either:
- Go to the [Build Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/boards/1697160) and pick from the `Ready` column
according to the priority labels.

or

- Go to the [Planning Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/boards/1697168) and try to advance issues
to the next appropriate column according to the priority labels.
