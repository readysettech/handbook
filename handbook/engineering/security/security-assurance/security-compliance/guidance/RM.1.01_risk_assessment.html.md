# RM.1.01 - Risk Assessment

## Control Statement

GitLab performs an annual security operational risk assessment to identify risks impacting security. The assessment considers both internal and external security risk factors, considerations over fraud and the impact of changes to the system. Results from the assessment are compiled into an annual report which is reviewed by management. Identified security risks are risk rated, assigned to a risk owner, and tracked through to risk treatment completion or risk acceptance.

## Context

Security operational risk assessments are important because they identify, prioritize, and help track the treatment of secruity risks to GitLab. The purpose of this control is to have a formalized annual security operational risk assessment process for risk identification, analysis, and treatment.

## Scope

The security operational risk assessment is performed at a level of precision that allows for the identification of security risks across the organization.

## Ownership

* Control Owner: `Security Compliance`
* Process owner(s): `Security Compliance`

## Guidance

The annual security operational risk assessment is performed in accordance with GitLab's [STORM Policy](/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/risk-management.html) and [Methodology](/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/operational-risk-management-methodology.html).
