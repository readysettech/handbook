# IR.2.01 - External Communication of Incidents

## Control Statement

GitLab defines external communication requirements for incidents, including:

* Information about external party dependencies.
* Criteria for notification to external parties as required by GitLab policy in the event of a security breach.
* Contact information for authorities (e.g., law enforcement, regulatory bodies, etc.).
* Provisions for updating and communicating external communication requirement changes.

## Context

This control demonstrates that we have documented how we will communicate externally in the event of an incident.  This helps the company by making sure we will contact the necessary external parties.

## Scope

This control applies to the external communication of security or infrastructure incidents.

## Ownership

* Control Owner: `Security Operations`
* Process owner(s):
    * Security Operations: `25%`
    * Security Communications: `25%`
    * Infrastructure Operations: `25%`
    * Infrastructure Communications: `25%`

## Guidance

This control ensures GitLab's incident response communications plan has and maintains the essential components of external incident communication.

## Additional control information and project tracking
