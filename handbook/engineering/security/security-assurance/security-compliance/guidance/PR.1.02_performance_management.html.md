# PR.1.02 - Performance Management

## Control Statement

GitLab performs ongoing performance management through regularly recurring 1:1 meetings between managers and their direct reports. Performance and compensation reviews are performed annually.

## Context

The purpose of this control is to ensure managers and their direct reports are in ongoing, open conversation with one another to stay current with projects, tasks, roadblocks, and so on. This benefits both parties - particularly with GitLab being all-remote and asynchronous - by facilitating regular feedback, timely issue escalation, decision making, and work prioritization.

## Scope

This control applies to GitLab management and leadership.

## Ownership

Control Owner:
* `People Operations`

Process Owner:
* People Operations


## Guidance

A process to evaluate the performance of team-members.
