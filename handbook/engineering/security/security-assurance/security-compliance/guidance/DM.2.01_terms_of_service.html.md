# DM.2.01 - Terms of Service

## Control Statement

Each new GitLab client must agree to the GitLab website Terms of Service which define the scope of services being provided including privacy and confidentiality requirements.

This promotes transparency and allows users to make informed choices. The purpose of this control is to ensure the ToS includes information on what personal information is collected and a mechanism to alert users of any changes is in place.

## Scope

This control applies to GitLab's ToS.

## Ownership
