### Templates and resources for research studies

#### User Interview Note Taking
[Note Taking Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hnIqg-fnCYW2XKHR8RBsO3cYLSMEZy2xUKmbiUluAY0/edit#gid=0). 

Used to collect raw observations on the participantâ€™s behavior and emotional feedback to the questions, as well as take notes. You can also create a new file directly from the template on Google Drive, by selecting it from one the default styles.

#### Usability Testing Script
[Script Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_5Qu2JR9QE5LE6cK4eq9yJs-nXv2rlWWifcjacaiWdI/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Usability Testing Rainbow Analysis Chart
[Rainbow Analysis Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bPg6op9Sk46lFVGaET-fruE0qz-ctNQsxbZKF-5lpn4/edit#gid=0). 

This approach uses a templated and color-coded spreadsheet to record what participants did during the test. For a thorough walkthrough on how to use this method, check out [this article](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/13/how-a-spreadsheet-can-make-usability-analysis-faster-and-easier/), or watch [this video of a GitLab researcher's experience using this method](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fYRTmaHZjMwDQfAnVpaEqHP1dByy1X5x/view?usp=sharing) (starts at 7:00).

#### Shared Google Drive for storing research videos and artifacts
