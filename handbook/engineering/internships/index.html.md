## Engineering Internship Pilot Program

GitLab is establishing an on-going internship program that can offer students, graduates, career switchers, and those returning to the workforce an opportunity to further their careers. We desire to create an inclusive program that will provide a fair and equal opportunity for all qualifying candidates.

We do not yet have a tried and tested program and are undertaking a limited pilot in 2020. This pilot will be used to validate and refine our approach to offering internships at an [all-remote company](/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/). For this reason, the structure and scope of this program will likely change in the future.

#### Duration and timing
A priority for the pilot program is attracting promising university students who are nearing graduation. Therefore, we are choosing dates that align with university academic calendars.

The pilot program will be 16 weeks starting 2020-05-11 until 2020-08-28.

#### Location
The internship program will primarily be [remote](/company/culture/all-remote/), with two weeks of co-location working.

1. Week 1: Intern Fast Boot - Remote
    - The interns will participate in a week of accelerated onboarding
    - **Updated 2020-03-16:** This week was originally scheduled as a co-located program. However, due to travel restrictions and public health concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are changing this to a remote program.
1. Weeks 2-15: Remote internship   
    - Interns will work remotely in their assigned team
1. Week 16: Intern send-off - Remote
    - The interns will focus in their final week on processing their experience and socialize with each other
    - **Updated 2020-06-22:** This week was originally scheduled as a co-located program. However, due to travel restrictions and public health concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are changing this to a remote program.

#### Internship day-to-day activities
1. Week 1: Intern Fast Boot
    - The program coordinators and mentors will facilitate a pre-defined program. The aim is to onboard the interns, prepare them for their 16 weeks of remote working, and set them up for success.
    - By the end of Week 1, we expect an intern will:
        - Have completed key [Day 1-5 onboarding tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates-2/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_intern_engineering.md)
        - Understand remote work and communication best practices
        - Set up their development environment
        - Work with their mentor to understand the development workflow and submit a small MR
        - Complete a Skill Gap Analysis with their engineering manager
        - Learn team specific processes
1. Weeks 2-15: Remote internship
    - An intern's daily schedule will generally reflect [how GitLab team members work](/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/), which is to say we will not impose a rigid schedule.
    - Interns will be encouraged to favor [async communication](/company/culture/all-remote/management/#asynchronous) and to [set their own work schedule](/handbook/values/#measure-results-not-hours).
    - Mentors and program coordinators will provide coaching if an intern needs help in adjusting to remote work.
    - Interns will participate in the following pre-determined activities
        - Weekly [1:1](/handbook/leadership/1-1/) with their manager
        - Weekly 1:1 with a mentor
        - Weekly 1:1 with an internship program coordinator
        - Weekly intern [coffee chat](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats)
        - 2-3 group meetings per week moderated by a program coordinator.
        - Regular pair programming sessions with a mentor and other team members.
1. Week 16: Intern send-off
    - The program coordinators and mentors will facilitate a pre-defined program. The aim is to process the experience, gather feedback, and share learnings.
    - During the Week 16 program, an intern will:
        - Complete offboarding tasks and hand-off projects if they are not continuing employment with GitLab.
        - Participate in [retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/internships/#team-retrospective) to help improve the internship program.
        - Complete final Skills Gap Analysis with their engineering manager
        - Share experiences and learnings with the company and wider-community through media such as blog posts and GitLab Unfiltered.

#### Compensation

Internships at GitLab offered in the framework described in this page will be paid and follow the same logic as that depicted in our [Compensation Calculator](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/) and according to our [Global Compensation Principles](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/). This means that, as usual, the San Francisco benchmark, location and experience factors will be taken into account during the recruitment process and before making an offer. Depending on country regulations, we will have to align with national labor laws.

### Recruitment
For the pilot, we will primarily target our advertising and promotion of the program at university students. However, we are not limiting candidate intake to university students and are open to all qualifying candidates.
We exclusively focus all our active sourcing activities on candidates from [underrepresented groups](/handbook/incentives/#add-on-bonus-for-select-underrepresented-groups).

#### Advertising
We advertise on all the traditional recruiting platforms as well as the GitLab vacancies page. Additional advertising is done on internship focussed job boards (e.g. Youtern, angel.co etc.)

#### University Recruitment
We proactively reach out to and engage with universities/colleges to hold a Virtual Careers Talk to encourage students at those universities to apply. Also, we reach out to any associations within these universities that represent underrepresented groups and hold Virtual Careers Talk with them.

We hold virtual talks at a minimum of five universities in the following regions: North America, Europe, APAC, MENA.

### Interviewing
We are setting the bar high at the application stage and introducing an automated online assessment to help with screening candidates.
These steps will allow us to work with a manageable number of candidates during the face-to-face interview stages.

#### Interview process
1. Comprehensive Application form including
    - Technical assignment
    - Situational questions rather than STAR, as candidates may not have any direct work/relatable experience.
    - Cover letter asking for candidates to specifically address defined areas.
1. Automated online technical assessment
1. Behavioral/Values interview panel \*
    - Hiring manager
    - Recruiter/HR
    - Misc Interviewer

\* Candidates must score a strong yes to move on to the panel interview stage.

### Criteria for teams requesting an intern
**Note 2020-09-01: Currently, we do not have an active Internship program. We are therefore not accepting any applications for the program today.**
GitLab teams are able to [apply for an intern](https://forms.gle/RgJGtsyDZcTriNuD7) to join their team.  

Applications get evaluated on the following criteria:
1. Mentorship
    - Does the team have a manager and 1-2 engineers willing to serve as mentors for the duration of the program?
    - Do the mentors have previous experience mentoring interns or junior engineers? Previous experience is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have.
1. Workload
    - Does the team have a roadmap containing low weight issues with few dependencies suitable for an intern?
1. Team Size and maturity
    - How established is this team? Will they be able to take on an intern without risking a decrease in velocity?     

The team manager and mentors will also need to be able to actively participate in the interview process.     

The Program Lead, Program coordinators, and VP of Engineering will evaluate the applications, and successful teams will be announced on 2019-12-09.
With the selection of hosting teams attributes of diversity (teams, locations, roles/function) will be taken into account. If it comes to a tie-break the VP of Engineering will be the DRI for the selection.

### Measuring success

#### Hiring process after the internship 

For future iterations of the internship we want to plan to bring interns onboard and save budget for their offers before the program starts. This should be planned in collaboration with the Leadership of the group and Finance Business Partner. 
 
For the pilot program the hosting teams will determine whether they would want to offer a fulltime role to the interns during the program. This is done based on two criteria: 
1. The budget/headcount availability in the team/department/division
1. The performance and skills assessment of the intern

*Note: If there's no budget/headcount availability in the team of the internship, the intern can research other opportunities in the organisation. An overview of the open internal roles can be viewed in [Greenhouse](https://gitlab.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board). If the role of interest is in a different team or job family, we would ask the intern to go through (a part of) the recruitment process again. This can include several steps of the [hiring process](/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#typical-hiring-timeline) such as Technical interview, Behavioral interview and Further interviews*

After the internship the aim would be to hire the intern as an Intermediate Engineer (depending on previous experience).
The timeline for hiring decisions would be as follows: 
- Week 8: Check in on feedback with all hosting teams
- Week 10: Performing performance/skills assessments with interns based on the Job Families and [Competencies](/handbook/competencies/#where-we-use-competencies)
- Week 11: Sharing feedback with interns
- Week 12: Aligning with Finance/Business on headcount/budget
- Week 12: Making a decision on offers to interns
- Week 13: Communicating the offer/no offer to interns
- Week 14: Awaiting final decision of interns 
- Week 16: End of the internship program

If an offer is not made or an offer is not accepted, there are opportunities to stay in touch with GitLab's team or People Business Partner and re-enter a conversation at a later time. 

#### Team Retrospective

Upon the completion of the pilot, participating teams will be asked to complete
a retrospective. This will follow the process used for GitLab's monthly
[team
retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/team-retrospectives/).
Engineering managers should create an issue in the
[gitlab-com/engineering-internships](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/engineering-internships)
project using the `Retrospective` template and customize it for their team. This
issue will initially be confidential.

During the retrospective all team members should be encouraged to contribute,
even if they didn't work directly with the intern, so that a complete picture
of the effect on the team can be built.

Following the retrospective period the issues will be made public.

#### GitLab Intern Feedback Survey

The feedback survey provides interns with the opportunity to freely express views about working at GitLab. The People Experience team will send the [Feedback Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffF8sAFDHTp0JAeum9XYHaG_PsFSHREssSpGECMeJJClXVrg/viewform) to all interns 2 days prior to the pilot programme completion. The People Business Partner & the intern may proactively set up time to discuss their responses and ask for further information. The feedback survey are not mandatory, however your input will help provide GitLab with information regarding what worked well and what can be improved in future iterations.
