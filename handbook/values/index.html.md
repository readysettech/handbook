## CREDIT

Our six values are
**🤝 Collaboration**,
**📈 Results**,
**⏱️ Efficiency**,
**🌐 Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging**,
**👣 Iteration**, and
**👁️ Transparency**,
and together they spell the **CREDIT** we give each other by assuming
good intent.

We take inspiration from other companies, and we always go for the [boring solutions](#boring-solutions).
Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better.
These values are a living document.
In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned (and scars earned) in the course of doing business.


## 🤝 Collaboration

Helping others is a priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve.
Similarly, you can rely on others for help and advice—in fact, you're expected to do so.
Anyone can chime in on any subject.
The person who's responsible for the work decides how to do it,
but they should always take each suggestion seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been implemented.

##### Kindness
We value caring for others.
Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback.
We disagree with companies that say [Evaluate People Accurately, Not "Kindly"](https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt).
We're all for accurate assessment, but we think it must be done in a kind way.
Give as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way.

##### Share
Be willing to invest in people and engage in open dialogue.
For example, consider making private issues public wherever possible so that we can all learn from the experience. Don't be afraid of judgement or scrutiny when sharing publicly, we all understand it's impossible to know everything.

Everyone can **remind** anyone in the company about our values.
If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.

Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and **speak up**.

##### Negative feedback is 1-1
Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible.
One-on-one video calls are preferred.
If you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer), please let your manager, the CEO, or the President know as soon as you realize it.
We want to solve problems while they are **small**.

Negative *feedback* is distinct from disagreement. If there is no direct feedback involved, strive to discuss disagreement in a public channel (e.g. the appropriate email group or Slack channel for your team), respectfully and [transparently](#transparency).

##### Say thanks
Recognize the people that helped you publicly, for example on the appropriate Slack channels.

##### Give feedback effectively
Giving feedback is challenging, but it's important to deliver it effectively.
When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself;
focus on the business impact and not the person.
Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example.
If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account.
For managers, it's important to realize that team members react to a negative incident with their managers [six times more strongly](https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-delicate-art-of-giving-fee) than they do to a positive one.
Keeping that in mind, if an error is so inconsequential that the value gained from providing criticism is low, it might make sense to keep that feedback to yourself.
In the situations where negative feedback must be given, focus on the purpose for that feedback: to improve the team member's performance going forward.
Give recognition generously, in the open, and often to [generate more engagement](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=LOW14298USEN) from your team.

##### Get to know each other
We use a lot of text-based communication, and if you know the person behind the text, it will be easier to prevent conflicts.
So we encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through video calls and team events.

##### Don't pull rank
If you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company, you're doing something wrong.
Explain why you're making the decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function.
This includes using the rank of another person - [including the CEO](https://twitter.com/EmiliejayG/status/1198731054162432000) - to sell an idea or decision.

##### Assume positive intent
We naturally have a double standard when it comes to the actions of others.
We blame circumstances for our own mistakes, but individuals for theirs.
This double standard is called the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error).
In order to mitigate this bias, you should always [assume positive intent](https://www.collaborativeway.com/general/a-ceos-advice-assume-positive-intent/) in your interactions with others, respecting their expertise and giving them grace in the face of what you might perceive as mistakes.
When [disagreeing](/handbook/values/#disagree-commit-and-disagree), folks sometimes argue against the weakest points of argument, or sometimes argue against a "straw man".
Assume the points are presented in good faith, and instead try to [argue the "steel man" (or the "strong man")](https://desert.glass/newsletter/week-46/):
> That’s when you articulate the absolute strongest version of your opponent’s position—potentially even stronger than the one they presented.
A good steel-man argument is one where the other person feels you've represented their argument well, even if they still disagree with your assumptions or conclusion.

##### Say sorry
If you made a mistake, apologize as soon as possible.
Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength.
The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes.
Additionally, when we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us, and the same mistake is less likely to be repeated by someone else.
Mistakes can include when you have not been kind to someone. In order to reinforce our values, it is important, and takes more courage, to apologize publicly when you have been unkind publicly (e.g., when you have said something unkind or unprofessional to an individual or group in a Slack channel).

##### No ego
Don't defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake.
You are not your work; you don't have to defend your point.
You do have to search for the right answer with help from others.

##### Don't let each other fail
Keep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck.
If you see someone who needs help, reach out and assist, or connect them with someone else who can provide expertise or assistance.
We succeed and shine together!

##### People are not their work
Always make suggestions about examples of work, not the person.
Say "You didn't respond to my feedback about the design" instead of "You never listen".
And, when receiving feedback, keep in mind that feedback is the best way to improve, and that others giving you feedback want to see you succeed.

##### Do it yourself
Our collaboration value is about helping each other when we have questions, need critique, or need help.
No need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or [do with two what you can do yourself](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/collaboration-is-the-enemy-of-innovation.html).

##### Blameless problem solving
Investigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure, rather than cast blame on a person or team.
We hold blameless [root cause analyses](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) for stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution.

##### It's impossible to know everything
We know we must rely on others for the expertise they have that we don't.
It's OK to admit you don't know something and to ask for help, even if doing so makes you feel vulnerable.
It is never too late to ask a question, and by doing so, you can get the information you need to produce results and to strengthen your own skills as well as the company as a whole.
After your question is answered, please document the answer appropriately so that it can be shared.

Don't display surprise when people say they don't know something, as it is important that everyone feels comfortable saying "I don't know" and "I don't understand."
(As inspired by [Recurse](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).)

##### Collaboration is not consensus
When collaborating, it is always important to stay above radar and work [transparently](/handbook/values/#transparency), but collaboration is not consensus.
You don't need to ask people for their input, and they shouldn't ask you "Why didn't you ask me?"
You don't have to wait for people to provide input, if you did ask them.
We believe in permissionless innovation—you don't need to involve people, but everyone can contribute.
This is core to how we [iterate](/handbook/values/#iteration), since we want smaller teams moving quickly rather than large teams achieving consensus slowly.

##### Collaboration is not playing politics
We don't want people to play politics.
One way to spot when this is happening is when people discussing a proposal focus overly on whose proposal it is.
This is a manifestation of the [Belief Bias](https://twitter.com/g_s_bhogal/status/1225561210139049984?), where we judge an argument’s strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how strongly *we* support the conclusion.
Proposals should be weighed on their merits and not on who proposed them.
The other thing to observe is whether people are being promoted based on others liking them or having a lot of alliances.
We want people to be promoted based on their results.
We do value collaboration, but that's different than being promoted just because people like you.

## 📈 Results
We do what we promised to each other, customers, users, and investors.

##### Measure results not hours
We care about what you achieve: the code you shipped, the user you made happy, and the team member you helped. Someone who took the afternoon
off shouldn't feel like they did something wrong. You don't have to defend how you spend your day. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid rules. Do not incite competition by proclaiming how many hours you worked yesterday. If you are working too many hours, talk to your manager to discuss solutions.

##### Give agency
We give people agency to focus on what they think is most beneficial. If a meeting doesn't seem interesting and someone's active participation is not critical to the outcome of the meeting, they can always opt to not attend, or during a video call they can work on other things if they want. Staying in the call may still make sense even if you are working on other tasks, so other peers can ping you and get fast answers when needed. This is particularly useful in multi-purpose meetings where you may be involved for just a few minutes.

##### Write promises down
Agree in writing on measurable goals.

##### Growth mindset
You don't always get results and this will result in criticism from yourself and/or others. We believe our talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others. We try to hire people based on [their trajectory](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means).

##### Global optimization
This name comes from the [quick guide to Stripe's culture](https://stripe.com/us/jobs/candidate-info?a=1#culture). Our definition of global optimization is that you do what is best for the organization as a whole. Don't optimize for the goals of your team when it negatively impacts the goals of other teams, our users, and/or the company. Those goals are also your problem and your job. Keep your team as lean as possible, and help other teams achieve their goals.
In the context of [collaboration](#collaboration), this means that if anyone is blocked by you on a question, your approval, or a merge request review, your top priority is always to unblock them, either directly or through helping them find someone else who can, even if this takes time away from your own or your team's priorities.

##### Tenacity
We refer to this as "persistence of purpose". As talked about in [The Influence Blog](https://www.learntoinfluence.com/developing-tenacity-when-facing-opposition/), tenacity is the ability to display commitment to what you believe in. You keep picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and quickly get going again having learned a little more. We value the ability to maintain focus and motivation when work is tough and asking for help when needed. 

##### Ownership
We expect team members to complete tasks that they are assigned. Having a task means you are responsible for anticipating and solving problems. As an owner, you are responsible for overcoming challenges, not suppliers or other team members. Take initiative and proactively inform stakeholders when there is something you might not be able to solve.

##### Sense of urgency
At an exponentially-scaling startup, time gained or lost has compounding effects. Try to get the results as fast as possible, but without compromising our other values and communication, so the compounding of results can begin and we can focus on the next improvement.

##### Ambitious
While we iterate with small changes, we strive for large, ambitious results.

##### Bias for Action
It's important that we keep our focus on action, and don't fall into the trap of analysis paralysis or sticking to a slow, quiet path without risk. Decisions should be thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally making mistakes; our bias for action also allows us to course correct quickly. Everyone will make mistakes, but it's the relative number of mistakes against all decisions made (i.e. percentage of mistakes), and the swift correction or resolution of that mistake, which is important. A key to success with transparency is to always combine an observation with questions to ensure understanding and suggestions for solutions / improvement to the group that can take action.  We don't take the easy path of general complaints without including and supporting the groups that can affect change. Success with transparency almost always requires effective [collaboration](#collaboration).

##### Accepting Uncertainty
We should strive to accept that there are things that we don’t know about the work we’re trying to do, and that the best way to drive out that uncertainty is not by layering analysis and conjecture over it, but rather accepting it and moving forward, driving it out as we go along. Wrong solutions can be fixed, but non-existent ones aren’t adjustable at all. [The Clever PM Blog](https://www.cleverpm.com/2018/08/23/accepting-uncertainty-is-the-key-to-agility/)

##### Customer results
Our focus is to improve the results that customers achieve, which requires being aware of [the Concur effect](https://twitter.com/ryanfalor/status/1182647229414166528?s=12), see [the Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21224209) for a specific UX example.
**Customer results are more important** than:

1. **What we want to make**.
1. **Large customers**. This leads to the [innovator's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma), so we should also focus on small customers and future customers (users).
1. **What customers first ask for**. This means we don't use the phrase "customer focus", because it tempts us to prioritize what the customer _says_ they want over what we discover they actually need through our product development process. Often, it’s easier for a customer to think in terms of a specific solution than to think about the core problem that needs to be solved. But a solution that works well for one customer isn’t always relevant to other customers, and it may not align with our overall product strategy. When a customer asks for something specific, we should strive to understand why, work to understand the broader impact, and then work together with the customer to agree on a solution that scales.
1. **Our existing scope**.
1. **Our assumptions**. Every company works differently, so we can’t assume that what works well for us will support our customers’ needs. When we have an idea, we must directly validate our assumptions with customers to ensure we create scalable, highly relevant solutions.
1. **What we control**. We should take responsibility for what the **customer experiences**, even when it isn’t entirely in our control. We aim to treat every customer-managed instance downtime as a $1M a day problem.


## ⏱️ Efficiency
We care about working on the right things, not doing more than needed, and not duplicating work. This enables us to achieve more progress, which makes our work more fulfilling.

##### Write things down
We document everything: in the handbook, in meeting notes, in issues.
We do that because "[the faintest pencil is better than the sharpest memory](https://www.quora.com/What-does-The-faintest-pencil-is-better-than-the-sharpest-memory-mean)."
It is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain. Having something in version control also lets everyone contribute suggestions to improve it.

##### Boring solutions
Use the simplest and most boring solution for a problem, and remember that [“boring” should not be conflated with “bad” or “technical debt.”](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)
The speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps.
Don’t pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun;
using established, popular tech will ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.

Make a conscious effort to **recognize** the constraints of others within the team.
For example, sales is hard because you are dependent on another organization, and development is hard because you have to preserve the ability to quickly improve the product in the future.

##### Self-service and self-learning
Team members should first search for their own answers and, if an answer is not readily found or the answer is not clear, ask in public. Write down any new information discovered and pay it forward so that those coming after will have better efficiency built on top of practicing collaboration, inclusion, and documenting the results.

##### Efficiency for the right group
It is easy to prioritize consistency over efficiency because consistency is often more efficient initially. We should slow down when optimizing for consistency. Taking a company-wide lens when evaluating changes will help ensure that new processes will improve efficiency for the company as a whole.

##### Be respectful of others' time
Consider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. If you are able to get through the agenda for a particular meeting under the allotted time, end the meeting early so that attendees can have their time back.

##### Spend company money like it's your own
Every dollar we spend will have to be earned back; be as frugal with company money as you are with your own.

##### ConvDev
We work according to the principles of [conversational development](http://conversationaldevelopment.com/).

##### Freedom
You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit.

##### Keep broadcasts short
Keep one-to-many written communication short, as mentioned in [this HBR study](https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-writing-is-destroying-your-companys-productivity): "A majority say that what they read is frequently ineffective because it’s too long, poorly organized, unclear, filled with jargon, and imprecise."

##### Managers of one
We want each team member to be a manager of one who doesn't need daily check-ins to achieve their goals.

##### Responsibility over rigidity
When possible, we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that, instead of imposing rules and approval processes.

##### Accept mistakes
Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient; a mistake only affects one.

##### Move fast by shipping the minimal viable change
We value constant improvement by iterating quickly, month after month. If a task is not the smallest thing possible, cut the scope.


## 🌐 Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging
Diversity, inclusion and belonging are fundamental to the success of a company. We aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We are designing a multidimensional approach to ensure that ReadySet is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to [build and institutionalize](http://www.russellreynolds.com/en/Insights/thought-leadership/Documents/Diversity%20and%20Inclusion%20GameChangers%20FINAL.PDF) a culture that is inclusive and supports all team members equally in the process of achieving their professional goals.

##### Bias towards asynchronous communication
Take initiative to operate asynchronously whenever possible. This shows care and consideration for those who may not be in the same time zone, are traveling outside of their usual time zone, or are structuring their day around pressing commitments at home or in their community.

This is demonstrated by using email, text, or Slack to communicate instead of calling or pressuring others to be online outside of their working hours; sharing meeting notes; checking busy notices on calendars; and being sensitive to local holidays and vacation statuses.

#### Embracing uncomfortable ideas and conversations 
Part of embracing diversity is a willingness to embrace often uncomfortable conversations and situations. This concept is also at the core of inclusion and helping to eliminate the problems that are faced by certain team members who may not be in the majority.

We believe at ReadySet that being willing to embrace discomfort is the path forward to a safe, balanced and inclusive work place for all. Challenge yourself, challenge your own pre-set notions and ideas about different cultures or things you don't understand. When we are willing to embrace being uncomfortable, we can focus on actually fixing the issues at hand rather than simply "appearing to care".

#### Understanding the impact of micro-aggressions
Micro-aggressions are much more than simply rude or insensitive comments. They have the capacity to wear people down like slowly chipping away at a persons sense of belonging/safety/inclusion over time. What is a micro-aggression? 

> "The everyday slights, indignities, put downs and insults that people of color, women, LGBT populations or those who are marginalized experiences in their day-to-day interactions with people." -  Derald W. Sue

At ReadySet we believe that everyone is entitled to a safe working space where they can express who they are and participate in conversations without worry of being spoken to in a harmful way, given that we want to encourage everyone to be mindful of what is a micro-aggression and be mindful of their potential impact. 

##### Reach across company departments
While it's wise to seek advice from experts within your function, we encourage team members to seek and provide feedback across departments. This enables the team to iterate more quickly, taking a more diverse perspective into account.

##### Make family feel welcome
One of the unique elements to a remote working culture is the ability to visit a person's home while collaborating. If the tenor of the meeting allows, feel welcome to invite your family members or pets to drop by and greet your colleagues. Be mindful of language and use of profanity to encourage a family-friendly environment.

##### Shift working hours for a cause
Caregiving, outreach programs, and community service do not conveniently wait for regular business hours to conclude. If there's a cause or community effort taking place, feel welcome to work with your manager and shift your working hours to be available during a period where you'll have the greatest impact for good. For colleagues supporting others during these causes, document everything and strive to post recordings so it's easy for them to catch up.

##### Culture fit is a bad excuse
We don't hire based on culture or select candidates because we'd like to have a drink with them. We hire and reward team members based on our shared values as detailed on this page. We want a **values fit**, not a culture fit.
We want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity, such as a [brogrammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogrammer) atmosphere. Said differently: ["culture add" > "culture fit"](https://twitter.com/Una/status/846808949672366080) or "hire for culture contribution".

##### Religion and politics at work
We generally avoid discussing politics or religion in public forums because it is easy to alienate people that have a minority opinion. This doesn’t mean we never discuss these topics. Because we value diversity, inclusion and belonging, and want all team members to feel welcome and contribute equally, we encourage free discussion of operational decisions that can move us toward being a more inclusive company.

There is sometimes a grey area where advocating for diversity and political activities may intersect. Team members should use discretion in grey area communications, because a culture of belonging requires us to be respectful of the broad spectrum of views within our work environment. What does this mean in practice? Please feel empowered to share information that highlights diversity, inclusion and belonging issues and how our team members can get involved.  

While it is acceptable for individuals to bring up politics and religion in social contexts such as coffee chats and real-life meetups with other coworkers (with the goal to understand and not judge), always be aware of potential sensitivities and exercise your best judgment. 

We have employees from all over the globe, where perspectives and local norms may differ from culture to culture. Diversity, inclusion and belonging is about broad inclusion at a worldwide level. If there is a question or concern, please feel free to reach out to your manager, the President, or the CEO.

##### Building a safe community
Do **not** make jokes or unfriendly remarks about characteristics of people and how they identify.
Everyone has the right to feel safe when working for ReadySet.
We do not tolerate abuse, [harassment](/handbook/anti-harassment/index.html.md), exclusion, discrimination, or retaliation by any team members.
You can always **refuse** to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.

##### Inclusive language & pronouns
Use **inclusive** language.
While there are several good guides from folks like [18f](https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/), [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/ucalgary-guidelines-updated-communicating-about-gender-and-sexual-diversity), and [Buffer](https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/) on using inclusive language, we don't keep an exhaustive list.
When new possibly non-inclusive words arise, we prefer to be proactive and look for an alternative.
If your goal is to be inclusive, it is more effective to make a small adjustment in the vocabulary when some people have a problem with it, rather than making a decision to not change it because some people don’t think it is a problem.
And if you make a mistake (e.g. accidentally using the wrong pronoun or an outdated phrase), acknowledge it, **apologize gracefully and move on**; there is no need to dwell on it, and you can work to avoid making that mistake in the future.

##### Inclusive meetings
Be consciously inclusive in meetings by giving everyone present an opportunity to talk and present their points of view. This can be especially important in a remote setting.

With internal meetings, consider using an open and live agenda document for questions.

Customers are not used to working in this way. To promote inclusion with customers: ask participants for their goals; make sure during demos that you pause for question; leave time for discussion.

##### See Something, Say Something
As a dispersed company, we have team members from many different backgrounds and cultures. That means it is important for each of us to use great judgment in being respectful and inclusive of our teammates. At the same time, we may sometimes not fully realize we have said or done something to offend someone. It is important that our teammates hold each other accountable and let them know if they have unintentionally or intentionally done something so they can learn and gain additional understanding of perspectives different from our own. It is also important that our teammates don't feel excluded or minimized by the words we use or the things we do. Thus, we all need to speak up when we see something that isn't respectful or inclusive.

##### Neurodiversity
[Neurodiversity](http://neurocosmopolitanism.com/neurodiversity-some-basic-terms-definitions/) is a type of diversity that includes: autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and other styles of neurodivergent functioning. While neurodivergent individuals often bring [unique skills and abilities](https://adhdatwork.add.org/potential-benefits-of-having-an-adhd-employee/) which can be harnessed for [competitive advantage](https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage) in many fields including [cybersecurity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samcurry/2019/05/13/neurodiversity-a-competitive-advantage-in-cybersecurity/), neurodivergent individuals are often discriminated against, and sometimes have trouble making it through traditional hiring processes. These individuals should be able to contribute as team members. The handbook, values, strategy, and interviewing process should never discriminate against the neurodivergent.

##### Family and friends first, work second
Long-lasting relationships are the rocks of life, and come before work.

## 👣 Iteration

We do the smallest thing possible and get it out as quickly as possible. Don't write a large plan; only write the first step. Trust that you'll know better how to proceed after something is released. You're doing it right if you're slightly embarrassed by the minimal feature set shipped in the first iteration. The impact both on your work process and on how much you achieve is greater than anticipated. In the beginning, it hurts to make decisions fast and to see that things are changed with less consultation. But frequently, the simplest version turns out to be the best one. People are trained that if you don't deliver a perfect or polished thing, you get dinged for it. If you do just one piece of something, you have to come back to it. Doing the whole thing seems more efficient, even though it isn't. If the complete picture is not clear, your work might not be perceived as you want it to be perceived. It seems better to make a comprehensive product. 

The way to resolve this is to write down only what you can do with the time you have for this project right now. That might be 5 minutes or 2 hours. Think of what you can complete in that time that would improve the current situation. Iteration can be uncomfortable, even painful. If you're doing iteration correctly, it should be.

However, if we take smaller steps and ship smaller, simpler features, we get feedback sooner. Instead of spending time working on the wrong feature or going in the wrong direction, we can ship the smallest product, receive fast feedback, and course correct. People might ask why something was not perfect. In that case, mention that it was an iteration, you spent only "x" amount of time on it, and that the next iteration will contain "y" and be ready on "z".

##### Don't wait
Don’t wait. When you have something of value like a potential blog post or a small fix, implement it straight away. Right now, everything is fresh in your head and you have the motivation. Inspiration is perishable. Don’t wait until you have a better version. Don’t wait until you record a better video. Don’t wait for an event. Inventory that isn’t released is a liability since it has to be managed, becomes outdated, and you miss out on the feedback you would have received had you implemented it straight away.

##### Set a Due Date
We always try to set a due date. If needed, we cut scope.
If we have something planned for a specific date, we make that date. But every one of them doesn't contain all the features we planned.
If we planned an announcement for a certain date, we might announce less or indicate what is still uncertain.
But we set a due date because having something out there builds trust and gives us better feedback.

##### Cleanup over sign-off
Waiting for approval can slow things down. We can prevent this with automation (e.g. tests of database migration performance) or clean-up after the fact (refactor if something was added that isn't coherent), but we try to ensure that people don't need to wait for signoff.

##### Work as part of the community
Small iterations make it easier to work with the wider community. Their work looks more like our work, and our work is also quicker to receive feedback.

##### Minimal Viable Change (MVC)
We encourage MVCs to be as small as possible. Always look to make the quickest change possible to improve the user's outcome. If you validate that the change adds more value than what is there now, then do it. No need to wait for something more robust. This applies to everything we do in all functions. Specifically for product MVCs, there is additional responsibility to validate with customers that we're adding useful functionality without obvious bugs or usability issues.

##### Make a proposal
If you need to decide something as a team, make a concrete proposal instead of calling a meeting to get everyone's input. Having a proposal will be a much more effective use of everyone's time. Every meeting should be a review of a proposal. We should be [brainwriting on our own instead of brainstorming out loud](https://www.fastcompany.com/3033567/brainstorming-doesnt-work-try-this-technique-instead). State the underlying problem so that people have enough context to propose reasonable alternatives. The people that receive the proposal should not feel left out and the person making it should not feel bad if a completely different proposal is implemented. Don't let your desire to be involved early or to see your solution implemented stand in the way of getting to the best outcome. If you don't have a proposal, don't let that stop you from highlighting a problem, but please state that you couldn't think of a good solution and list any solutions you considered.

##### Everything is in draft
We rarely mark any content or proposals as drafts. Everything is always in draft and subject to change, including this handbook.

##### Under construction
As we get more users, they will ask for stability, especially in our UX. We should always optimize for the long term. This means that users will be inconvenienced in the short term, but current and future users will enjoy a better product in the end.

##### Focus on Improvement
We believe great companies sound negative because they focus on what they can improve, not on what is working.
Our first question in every conversation with someone outside the company should be: What do you think we can improve?
This doesn't mean we don't recognize our successes; for example, see our [Say Thanks](#say-thanks) value.
We are positive about the future of the company; we are present-day pessimists and long-term optimists.

##### Do things that don't scale
First, optimize for speed and results; when it is a success, figure out how to scale it. Great examples are in [this article by Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).

##### Make two-way door decisions
Most decisions are easy to reverse. In these cases, the directly responsible individual should go ahead and make them without approval. There should be a more thorough discussion only when you can't reverse a decision.

##### Changing proposals isn't iteration
Changing a proposal isn't iterating. Only when the change is rolled out to users can you learn from feedback. When you're changing a proposal based on different opinions, you're frequently wasting time; it would be better to roll out a small change quickly and get real world feedback.

##### Make small merge requests
When you are submitting a merge request for a code change, or a process change in
the handbook, keep it as small as possible. If you are adding a new page to the
handbook, create the new page with a small amount of initial content, get it merged
quickly, and then add additional sections iteratively with subsequent merge requests. 
Similarly, if you are adding a large feature to the software, create small, iterative merge requests for the different aspects. These merge requests might not provide immediate value, as long as they do not break anything and have appropriate tests for new functionality. If you aren't sure how to split something into small, iterative merge requests, consider kindly asking your team and/or maintainers for suggestions.
If you are asked to review a merge request that is too big, consider kindly asking
the author to split it into smaller merge requests before reviewing.

##### When we iterate slowly
In some cases, rapid iteration can get in the way of [results](#results). In those instances, we add additional review to the approval
process; not to prohibit, but to be more deliberate in our iteration. The change process is documented in the [Handbook Usage](/handbook/handbook-usage/index.html.md) page and takes place via merge request approvals.


## 👁️ Transparency

Be open about as many things as possible within the company. By making information
easily available, we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. We accept that we occasionally make mistakes in the direction of transparency. Making mistakes and reflecting on them means we know where the limit of transparency is.

##### Not public
We make most information internally public. However, it is [most important to focus on results](#hierarchy). Therefore, information may be limited access due to privacy considerations, contractual obligation, or other reasons that the owner or DRI can specify.

##### Directness
Being direct is about being transparent with each other. We try to be both straightforward
and kind when giving feedback. Feedback is always about your work and not your person. That doesn't mean it will be easy to give or receive it.

##### Articulate when you change your mind
If you state one thing, and then change course and support a different direction, point, or outcome, articulate this. It is OK to have your position changed by new data. Articulating that an *earlier* stance is not your *current* stance provides clarity to others and encourages data-driven decision making. 

##### Surface issues constructively
Be transparent to the right people (up) at the right time (when still actionable). If you make a mistake, don't worry; correct it and **proactively** let the affected party and your team know what happened, how you corrected it, and how—if needed—you changed the process to prevent future mistakes.

##### Anyone and anything can be questioned
Any past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act in accordance with them until they are changed.

##### Disagree, commit, and disagree
Everything can be questioned, but as long as a decision is in place, we expect people to commit to executing it, which is [a common principle](http://ryanestis.com/leadership/disagree-and-commit-to-get-things-done/).
In a manager-report circumstance, usually the report is the DRI.
The manager may disagree with the final decision, but they still commit to the decision of the DRI.

When you want to reopen the conversation on something, show that your argument is informed by previous conversations and [assume the decision was made with the best intent](#assume-positive-intent).
You have to achieve results on every decision while it stands, even when you are trying to have it changed.
You should communicate with the DRI who can change the decision instead of someone who can't.

##### Findability
Our transparency value means more than just making information accessible to all. In order to improve performance, it's important that we not only ensure information is accessible, but also ensure it flows to the correct places and is [findable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability) by those who need it. Focusing on information flow will ensure you, for example, utilize multi-modal communication, or that you keep your stakeholders informed of changes by posting links to MRs in Slack.

##### Say why, not just what
Transparent changes have the reasons for the change laid out clearly along with the change itself. This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning, which is less efficient. 

This also helps with institutional memory: a year from now when you want to know why a decision was made, or not, the issue or MR that has the decision also shares why the decision was made. 
This is related to [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence) - it's much easier to suggest removing or changing something if you know why it exists in the first place.

Avoid using terms such as "industry standard" or "best practices" as they are vague, opaque, and don't provide enough context as a reason for a change.

Similarly, merely stating a single value isn't a great explanation for why we are making a particular decision. Many things could be considered "iteration" or "efficiency" that don't match our definition of those values. Try to link to a sub-value of the value or provide more context, instead of just saying a single value's name.

Saying why and not just what enables discussion around topics that may impact more than one value; for instance, when weighing the [efficiency of boring solutions](#boring-solutions) with the focus on [customer results](#customer-results). When decisions align with all of our values, they are easy to discuss and decide. When there are multiple values involved, using our [values hierarchy](#hierarchy) and [directly](#directness) discussing the tradeoffs is easier with more context.

Articulating why also helps people understand how something changed when you [articulate that you changed your mind](#articulate-when-you-change-your-mind).

Saying why does not mean justifying a decision against all other suggestions. 
The assigned DRI (directly responsible individual) is responsible for their decision. 
The DRI is not responsible for convincing other people, but they should be able to articulate their reasoning for the change. 

##### Reproducibility
Enable everybody involved to come to the same conclusion as you. This not only involves [reasoning](#say-why-not-just-what), but also providing, for example: raw data and not just plots; scripts to automate tasks and not just the work they have done; and documenting steps while analyzing a problem. Do your best to make the line of thinking transparent to others, even if they may disagree.



## Five dysfunctions

Our values help us to prevent the [five dysfunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team#Summary):

1. **Absence of trust** Unwilling to be vulnerable within the group => _prevented by collaboration, specifically_ [kindness](#kindness)
1. **Fear of conflict** Seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate => _prevented by transparency, specifically_ [directness](#directness) _and collaboration_.
1. **Lack of commitment** Feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization => _prevented by transparency, specifically_ [directness](#directness)
1. **Avoidance of accountability** Ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards => _prevented by results, iteration, and_ [transparency](#transparency)
1. **Inattention to results** Focusing on personal success, status, and ego before team success => _prevented by_ [results](#results)

Some dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values; for example, trust is not one of our values.
Similar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly.
We hope that the way we work and our values will instill trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given.

## Why have values

Our values should give guidelines on how to behave and must be actionable.
They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from people we hire.
They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others.
Values are a framework for distributed decision making; they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.

## Making large-scale decisions transparently

*For certain business decisions or projects, team members may have a lot of opinions and interest, 
and they want to provide their feedback and comments. 
On the other hand,  it might be challenging for the project DRI to digest and respond to all these inputs. 
What should you do in this scenario?* 

We encourage team members to share feedback. 
Leaving feedback and comments shows that team members care about a topic and about ReadySet as a company. 
These perspectives may also uncover potential risks and problems in the project. 

There shouldn't be a “Don’t they have their job to do?” type of response. 
Furthermore, we shouldn’t judge team members who are perceived as being the “squeaky wheel.”  
We [measure results, not hours](#measure-results-not-hours). 
As long as a team member is producing required results, they are empowered to decide how to spend their time. 

On the other hand, as we grow in size, we need to make decisions and the decisions may not be agreed upon by everyone.  
If a decision or project is sensitive or controversial, and receives large amounts of feedback, it can be challenging for the project DRI to handle. 
In these cases, it's best to have have time-boxed feedback built into timelines.

In a hypothetical example where a DRI needs to decide between red and gold potatoes for a stew, they would communicate the following sentiment:

> We’re deciding between red potatoes and gold potatoes to go into the soup. We have to decide by Tuesday 2020-07-14 so that we can get our order to the grocery store on Wednesday 2020-07-15. We’ll be collecting input and feedback until that point. Jane is the DRI and will make the decision on 2020-07-14 with all the information we have at that point. Here is the framework we’re using for the decision:
>
> * are there allergies to consider?
> * cost per pound
> * team member preferences
>
> Once the decision is made, it will be what is going into the stew.

This method is effective at soliciting productive feedback that doesn't derail a timeline while ensuring team members feel heard. 


## Hierarchy

Occasionally, values can contradict each other. For instance, transparency would dictate we publish all security vulnerabilities the moment they are found, but this would jeopardize our users. In the end, results matter most for a company. We trust that our other values and processes will lead to better results. It's useful to keep in mind the reasoning behind our values to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance while maintaining consistency.


## What to do if values aren't being lived out

Value erosion can occur when indifference and apathy are tolerated. It can also occur when individuals justify undesired behaviors by interpreting values as "me values" rather than "company values." For example, a team member may speak to the importance of personal efficiency in order to justify not collaborating professionally with peers. This is not what we expect from team members in terms of efficiency and collaboration. 

If you feel that values are not being lived out in a given scenario, speak up and ask for context in a respectful manner. Navigating value conflicts starts with [assuming positive intent](#assume-positive-intent) from other team members. Offer links to relevant values and/or sub-values when discussing the issue.

## Permission to play

From our values we excluded some behaviors that are obvious; we call them our *permission to play* behavior:

1. Be truthful and honest.
1. Be dependable, reliable, fair, and respectful.
1. Be committed, creative, inspiring, and passionate.
1. Be deserving of the trust of our team members, users and customers.
1. Act in the best interest of the company, our team members, our customers, users, and investors.
1. Act in accordance with the law.
1. Don't show favoritism as [it breeds resentment, destroys employee morale, and creates disincentives for good performance](https://www.employmentlawfirms.com/resources/employment/discrimination/laws-preventing-favoritism-in-the-workplace). Seek out ways to be fair to everyone.
