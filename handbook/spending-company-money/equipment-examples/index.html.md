### Adapters and cables

#### A note on HDMI and 4K@60Hz

If you need HDMI connectivity (e.g. to connect a TV, projector or monitor) and are looking for a USB-C adapter or hub that supports [4K resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution) (3840 × 2160 pixels), be aware that most of the adapters and hubs on the market only support refresh rate of 30 Hz (i.e. 30 frames per second). This is ok for movies, but not great for interactive work. For example, mouse pointer will noticeably jump on a 30 Hz screen when you move it. Scrolling text is even worse. All that puts extra strain on your eyes. There are products that support refresh rate of 60 Hz and they cost roughly the same. Look for 4K@60Hz in product specification. If you bought one and it still does not give you the desired refresh rate, make sure your HDMI cable supports it. [HDMI 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Version_2.0) and newer cables do.
