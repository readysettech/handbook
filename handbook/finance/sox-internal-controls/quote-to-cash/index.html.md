Leads are generated from various sources like campaigns, events, trade shows, road shows, sponsor meetups, inbound traffic for a 30-day trial version, etc. Customer Account is created in Salesforce when the lead is assessed as qualified.

Accounts, contacts and opportunities are usually created by a salesperson from the sales team. However, it is the responsibility of the Sales Operations team to review all the creations and assist salespersons in creation if required. 

The sales operations team reviews the transaction and identifies if it is a new, upsell or renewal transaction and creates an account only if needed.

At the time of account creation, the Legal team reviews the transaction for trade compliance issues and ensures not selling to a restricted country.

The Sales Operations team reviews if the transaction is with a related party and flags the transaction accordingly.

The report contains the name of the account to be invoiced, subscription reference, start date and end date. For each of the accounts to be invoiced, the billing team manually creates a bill run in Zuora as per the procedure detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Nz45SeGHR4ooUZWwJgD8lnXm2MTTnWYeywd9bnMA2U/edit).

   - Under the [“opportunities”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yIHfEYzsvNx2j1XAvVn8Rho3NkmMAvJcVMCTbcJIz5Q/edit) section, select the renewal opportunity.

## 8. Revenue Recognition and Accounting for other quote to cash transactions in NetSuite


[Link to Flowchart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zKCzRpzlKRaEReenBsTge6Be7GkbshXf0A2nqikVo94/edit#slide=id.g7a75e78db3_0_0)

The revenue to be recognized for the period is ascertained based on the revenue run executed in Zuora. The revenue recognition process is carried out monthly.

To comply with ASC 606 requirements, GitLab has modified its practice of recognising 100% of revenues for product subscriptions on a straight line basis to recognising revenue on basis of performance obligations. This has resulted revenue being recognised in the following manner:

| One Year Subscription     | Starter | Premium | Ultimate |
|---------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Upfront                   |   15%   |   10%   |    5%    |
| Over the life of contract |   85%   |   90%   |    95%   |
| Total                     |   100%  |   100%  |   100%   |

| Two Year Subscription     | Starter | Premium | Ultimate |
|---------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Upfront                   |   8.1%  |   5.3%  |   2.6%   |
| Over the life of contract |  91.9%  |  94.7%  |   97.4%  |
| Total                     |   100%  |   100%  |   100%   |

| Three Year Subscription   | Starter | Premium | Ultimate |
|---------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Upfront                   |   5.6%  |   3.6%  |   1.7%   |
| Over the life of contract |  94.4%  |  96.4%  |   98.3%  |
| Total                     |   100%  |   100%  |   100%   |

This is calculated automatically in Zuora during the revenue run execution, based on revenue recognition rules defined in the product master. 

Currently revenue recognition for services is made on completion of service. The revenue schedule for services is manually updated on completion of service. However, going forward GitLab expects to commence recognizing revenue in a progressive manner based on the percentage of completion method (with hours as the input).

All transactions in quote to cash process recorded in Zuora (invoicing, cancellations, collections and refunds) are summarized at the end of the month along with revenue recognition for the month based on a report generated from Zuora. The transactions are accounted in NetSuite as a journal.

**8.1. Updating revenue schedule for services**

Considering that Professional services is still at a nascent stage, currently revenue recognition is deferred until the customer sign off is obtained on services. In cases where customer sign off is not obtained the revenue is recognised after a quiet period after completion of work.

Future considerations: From the period 2020-21 Professional services would have completed 2 full years since introduction, therefore it would be easier to establish customer acceptance criteria and build robust processes supported by tools to estimate budgeted hours and report actual time incurred against the original project estimates. This would allow the company to commence recognizing revenue in a progressive manner based on completion method (with hours as the input).

[Sample SOW](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IqQHMCNQEyWDJ5cNCNtWNKQmQnVVob5d)

- **Project completion and sign off**

[Link to Flowchart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EHPu9_TI9lFUPek-0fD2WjWbP_devWR4y3tfR8PTgUE/edit)

There are two models in which customers can use the product:<br>
    1. On premise model i.e self managed<br>
    2. On cloud model

In case of a self managed model the customer downloads the products onto their server and manages the product.

In the case of the on cloud model the product is hosted on GitLab server and is available to customers through the internet.



**1. On Premise Model**

Sales is made to customer through following channels:

**a. Web Direct Sales:**

Customer logs in to Customers Portal and directly buys the product as per their requirements.

* Step 1: Customer completes the purchase in Customers Portal and credit card details go through. An opportunity is automatically created in Salesforce.

* Step 2: Transaction is automatically pushed  to Zuora from Salesforce once purchase is successful.

* Step 3: Zuora pushes the customer information along with Zuora reference number to the [customer portal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLiq3IegyaFZISDUAXcDVt87PzGS3zn8SKZrRvcJgYY/edit). 

* Step 4: Upon successful receipt of Zuora reference number the customer portal will push the details to the license application . Details such as customer info, contact details and product details are automatically pushed into the [license app](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSIewFE_uDiTyLolFC1CHbYAwTFDgGm25Wy_HWxY-pw/edit).

* Step 5: license application automatically sends license Key to customer through an email, alternatively customer can also download the license key through customer portal.

**Manual generation and dispatch of Duplicate License Key**

Broadly there are three circumstances in which License keys needs to be generated and dispatched manually:<br>

         
1.  Customer faces difficulty in accessing the license key and raises a ticket via Zendesk.<br>

    * Step 1: Ticket is received in Zendesk (User raises the [ticket](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hkvV72IDzKB5QXD0BIWZWtvIeQ-dHCIWwyZG7nogR4Q/edit) for help).

    * Step 2: Based on the problem the Support Engineer decides how the problem is to be solved and [whether a duplicate license key is required](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OO7Fi2Re2ol7mipu_RVbhtkrqWlgDSt6WKDluKLSjHU/edit). 

    * Step 3: If a duplicate license key is required, Support Engineer will generate a duplicate license key by clicking on “Duplicate licenses” under the [Edit licenses tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aehHB8cTT0VY0k4bK-_T4bzgAJzRt-dpC-wvWQY8MR0/edit).

    * Step 4 : Support Engineer enters [details of number of users](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hQbtXvgEX__Jqeu2wIP3A6VN5I0lh_uZG0gkb94mcuw/edit) that require access to duplicate licenses. 

    * Step 5: Support Engineer to reference the Zendesk ticket or Internal GitLab issue and enter any comments and notes required in the [“Notes” section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xj4SBCj0_XSRkO5CoIi6Z8e56_w8cDgVv7vT3w9PNTY/edit).

    * Step 6: To generate the duplicate license Key, the support engineer clicks on [“Create license”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjwqgBdWkEXHtORiu9q7itf4qQpVEykDv22TfHv9SYc/edit).


2.  Sales team offers trial license keys to Prospective/ Current customers.<br>
3.  Sales team decides to issue the license manually  (In these cases, the billing team marks the customer’s profile as “Silent” in Zuora. This causes the licence to not generate automatically).<br>






**Subscription Cancellations:**

Customers can cancel the subscription anytime within 45 days and avail full refund for the amount paid. Based on customer requests the billing team cancels the subscription and invoice  in zuora and creates an opportunity with a negative value in Salesforce.

<br>


**2. On Cloud  Model**

In the on cloud model there is no concept of Licence Keys, the successful provisioning of an account will automatically enable the customer to start using the account.<br>
Once a purchase has been made the customer has to connect their customer account (Customer Portal) with GitLab.com by opening both the tabs simultaneously and selecting the connect option available in the customer portal.


**a. Web Direct Sales:**

Customer logs in to Customers Portal and directly buys the product as per their requirements.


* Step 1: Customer logs on to the Customer Portal and  clicks on [“Buy new subscription”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rMWfTtj76ye3xuNGqgjBvItEQsUwJhDwLHot0bnbi1o/edit) to select the subscription needed. If the customer is an already existing customer then the system [prompts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jsnXvmMNiYTlkO_Xro2U4mEN5_wC5Qi1O4VPhtHpuxE/edit) if the customer wants to manage an existing account or add a new subscription.

* Step 2: Customer selects the subscription that clicks on [“Order Plan”.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNSXqrKWABLit63V-OVdztQf4vymmBvDTRJJOofS5WI/edit)

* Step 3: Customers need to [connect](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjIsTZjOYKsbFCAudrP5Hz_VEAuVqMJbtr4tzJWOjJc/edit) their account to GitLab.com account. Once the account is connected to GitLab.com, the system automatically calculates the number of existing users in case of an upgrade.

* Step 4: Once the purchase is completed, the system automatically provisions the account by [updating the plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FY3DiHg8_DHN2XnQ3JjTL1XmNw4bGbVRIuYALBNuWw8/edit) in the user account. 



**b. Sales team assisted sales:**

Sales team is involved in the sales process, SalesForce is used to create customer accounts, send out quotes and close the deal.

* Step 1: Sales team completes the sales and[ marks the opportunity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rH4-Uk0GI71Cc-QUVIVufCRUXX6ohN1nZ0_hAdvQsLM/edit) as closed and won in SalesForce.
 
* Step 2: Upon closing of opportunity as “Closed and won” in SalesForce, the Billing Team  sends the quote to Zuora leading to creation of customer subscription in Zuora. Once a customer subscription is created in Zuora, Zuora automatically pushes the customer [details to Customer portal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15uwg8uDjfylopuh3CuNnRGAOOEN6_GCf57KLLfKj93s/edit). 

* Step 3: Customers need to [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aBqXQppzo99Uoa91q1Y7x9q9MYt91PrPWFpqiVEOBqA/edit) the GitLab customer portal with their account in GitLab.com. Click on the “My accounts” option in Customer portal and select account details option.

* Step 4: Click on [Link Account/Change linked account](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtega3-recCDwl7UvgSt4Cywd5jwRkvShS_mvLObgOE/edit) option.

* Step 5: Log on to a different browser tab and log in to GitLab.com. Come back to Customer portal and Click on [“Change linked account/Link account”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xtp_m_ZWxxwKYrPcPz-bkicDtTWHl-hulBKMNYFQOzc/edit) to connect both the accounts. There is an API Cache that has the login details, once the “Change linked account/Link account” button is selected the accounts get linked.

* Step 6: Now the customer needs to [link the name space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zaC76xddppTwwT-MoMQmilp2FSZSRCQZF3fRwEZhjOY/edit). Because on GitLab.com a customer can have unlimited number of groups and the customer can link their subscription to any one of the groups or your personal namespace. This process basically indicates to the system as to where the subscription is applied to.

* Step 7: Select “[Change linked namespace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XwAKdUpNbcFKYHl5X3JqjhXEYg4-xeYyH3pXzQJGkU8/edit)” and come into the namespace by clicking on the namespace.

* Step 8: Select the subscription and click on “[Processed to checkout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18-fSatW1vRMck-W1hlohrp-f_Vw_nsvJ6-oVsMXM7FY/edit)” to apply the selection.

* Step 9: Once “Proceed to check out” is selected the system [reads the number of users](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzBy_ncsWLeBzaoM-RWEYUcvVb65bTd3pGpmjz4FqSA/edit) in that particular group or namespace and if it was more than the seats that were sold then the system will walk the customer through the payment for overage. 


**Subscription Cancellations:**

**Premature cancellation: Cancellation within the first 45 days.**

Ideally once the billing team cancels the subscription in Zuora, Zuora creates an amended invoice and based on the amended invoice customer portal instructs GitLab.com to downgrade the customer account to the basic version.  
Since this is not happening automatically, GitLab admin downgrades the account manually.

* Step 1: Billing team creates an internal [issue](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UrAMTI53Qj5XvvFi4Q-BZnkKJhqkbvkYZ2XKQ62ri1g/edit) for the support team to have the subscription cancelled manually.

* Step 2: Support admin goes into the actual customer account and select the “[Edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oSHzf4j54Ak_lrSeEBAFcuaqcY-yRMtFMkfXLBX0Eyw/edit)” button.
 
* Step 3: And [change the existing plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17P10gzJfNJPNxjgduzNXJebCli36y085N_9t6x3IMUM/edit) i.e “Gold” to “No Plan”.

* Step 4: Update the [pipeline minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13JI525IrqJZCJRb6TmpMW88e110OBud3nS4cgXruGNE/edit) to reflect the pipeline minutes of the downgraded plan.

* Step 5: Enter a [note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tGInLoXsgEuoPQFalI6XrSOTcOD8joYmf61gotYjbzM/edit) to maintain details of why the change was made and provide a link to the issue created by the billing team requesting the changes. A note can only be entered when cancelling a user account, when cancelling a group account, there is no admin note feature. 

* Step 6: Click on “[Save changes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FlGUy8Sq0qs0dS3Wq8EkbcpLHtzlNnMFH1FOTrvBbFU/edit)” to give effect to the changes.


**Cancellations due to failure to renew the subscription by customer:**

Due to system limitations currently the cancellation/downgrades of the customer account from paid subscription to “Free Plan” does not happen. This has resulted in multiple accounts continuing to have access to paid features even after expiration of the subscription period. However the support services for these accounts are shut down.<br>
