## Support Learning Pathways

All the learning pathways we have in Support are listed [here](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-subject.html). Each pathway contains a set of modules, and a module may reside in multiple pathways.

To create an issue for yourself with one of the module templates:

- Click on the module you want to pursue from the [Skills by Subject](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-subject.html) page
- Title it as **_Your Name_: _Module Name_**
- Assign it to yourself
- Now you're all set to follow the instructions in the module!

### Support Onboarding Pathway

When you first join the team everything will be new to you. Don't worry! In order to get you started with GitLab quickly, apart from the company wide onboarding issue that will be assigned to you on Day 1 by PeopleOps, we also have an onboarding program in Support. There are two pathways:

1. [Support Engineer Onboarding Pathway](#support-engineer-onboarding-pathway)
1. [Support Manager Onboarding Pathway](#support-manager-onboarding-pathway)

**NOTE:** You can start the PeopleOps onboarding and the Support Onboarding at the same time, or you can complete PeopleOps and then switch to Support. Determine the best path with your manager.

### Support Engineer Onboarding Pathway

Your primary Support Engineer Onboarding Issue is based on the [New Support Team Member Start Here template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/New-Support-Team-Member-Start-Here.md). This Issue keeps track of and completes the onboarding modules shown in the following table.

It is recommended that you complete the modules in the order listed, unless an issue mentions that you can start something else simultaneously. Typically, for a new team member in Support, completion of the below onboarding modules (including those in the Area of Focus Pathway) should take **8 weeks**.

## Support Training Project

We are continuously working on adding more modules and building out more learning pathways: you can find a list of all our current training modules and Bootcamps in the [Support Training project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates).

## Support Engineer Achievable Progress - First 6 Months

Our onboarding pathway gives new Support Engineers an opportunity to learn at their own pace and explore. We strongly believe in learning by doing ([70/20/10 learning model](https://trainingindustry.com/wiki/content-development/the-702010-model-for-learning-and-development/)), and encourage Support Engineers to start contributing on tickets (with public or internal comments) from as early as your 3rd week. 

**NOTE:** The 6 months starts after your initial [Support Learning Pathways](#support-learning-pathways) are complete.

The following reference table can be used as a guideline on achieving comfort with ticket management in your first 6 months in GitLab Support. Managers can also use this table to gauge the progress of new hires in their first 6 months after onboarding.

**NOTE:** Table data is shown by month - for instance, in my 4th month as a Dotcom support engineer, I can aim to make about 60+ comments on tickets.

| Month | Public Comments Reference Range - Self-managed | Public Comments Reference Range - Dotcom |
| ------ |  ------ | ------ |
| 1 | 0-10 | 0-20 |
| 2 | 10-30 | 20-40 |
| 3 | 30-50 | 40-60 |
| 4 | 50+ | 60+ |
| 5 | 60+ | 80+ |
| 6 | 70+ | 100+ |
