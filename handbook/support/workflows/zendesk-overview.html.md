## Organizations

[Organizations](handbook/support/workflows/zendesk_organizations_and_users_overview.html) are collections of your users (both customers and Zendesk agents). Users can belong to multiple organizations, up to 300. Organizations help us keep track of what our customers are requesting. We can also enable users within an organization to see each otherâ€™s tickets.

## Macros

We use Zendesk Macros as a tool to help support common workflows and allow us to support our customers faster. It's important to find a balance of when and where to use a macro. Read more about how we use macros at GitLab in our [Macros](/handbook/support/workflows/macros.html) page

## Reporting

We currently have 3 reporting tools available:

- Sisense - We use [Sisense](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/platform/periscope/) mostly to track our KPIs
- Explore - Newest Zendesk Reporting tool. Customer analytics toolkit that helps us measure and optimize every interaction a customer has with GitLab.
- Insights/GoodData - Zendesk Legavy reporting tool. Insights is an analytics offering with data and best-practice dashboards. It will be discontinued in the future in favour of Explore, no specific date has been announced.

## Ticket Fields

Ticket fields are used to gather more information about the support issue. They can be either: Editable by agents only, editable by end-users and agents, and required by end-users.

Most of our ticket fields are filled out by the customer before submitting an issue, however when we receive tickets through email or when the ticket fields are not required, we need to [fill out fields manually](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets.html#filling-out-fields-on-tickets) before solving them.
