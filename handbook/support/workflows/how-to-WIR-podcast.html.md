##### Workflow
1. Determine who will be responsible for each of the following roles. One person can be responsible for them all.
   - Editor: 
      - add theme music
      - ensure the audio levels are consistent across recordings
      - coalesce all of the audio files into the final mix using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (or something else)
      - publish the final mix onto Slack and link into the WIR document

   - Narrator(s):
      - analyze the content of the section you'll be narrating: click on each link and understand what is being expressed by the point
      - create a script that describes the content of each point in your section
      - read and record the content of your script
      - export the audio and provide it to the editor before the WIR discussion link is generated

   - Metrics analyst
      - review the current OKRs and formulate an analysis of any trends
      - take screenshots of the key metrics and paste them into the WIR document
      - in text, enter key metrics into the appropriate sections of the WIR document
      - write a script summarizing your findings
      - read and record the content of your script
      - export the audio and provide it to the editor before the WIR discussion link is generated


2. Execute the above before the discussion thread hits Slack.
