## Sentry

*Note*: Sentry organizes applications into "Sentry Teams". To investigate errors
across different applications or environments, our primary teams used are `#gitlab`
(for the production rails application) and `#gitlab-internal` (for non-production
environments). By joining said Sentry Team, the application errors should be viewable.

1. Obtain the full URL the user was visiting when the error occurred along with their user ID, if needed for searching.
1. [Log in to Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/).
1. Enter a query into the search field. For example, the following query would display any errors events encountered by the user with the ID `123456`:

```
is:unresolved user.id:123456
```

In addition to searching by user ID, you can also use `user.username:` and `url:` to search by GitLab.com username (case-sensitive) and specific page on GitLab.com, respectively. You can also select filtering values by clicking the "filter" button located directly to the right of the search bar.

At times a search will turn up a Sentry issue that appears to reference the information (user ID, URL, etc...) of another user and not the one that reported the issue. If this happens and you need to create an issue for that specific reporter, simply click the `Events` tab as seen below to view a list of all users affected by that issue.

You can then click a specific event to view the Sentry issue for that user.

See the [Sentry guide](https://docs.getsentry.com/hosted/learn/search/) and [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j1J4NhGQEYBY8la6lCK-N-bw749TbcTSFTD-ANHiels/edit#slide=id.p) (GitLab internal only) for more information.
