# Zendesk SLA Policies

From Zendesk:

> A Service Level Agreement, or SLA, is an agreed upon measure of the response
> and resolution times that your support team delivers to your customers.
> Providing support based on service levels ensures that you're delivering
> measured and predictable service. It also provides greater visibility when
> problems arise.

Keep in mind only 1 SLA policy can be in place for a ticket. As such, it will
use the top most SLA based on the list of our SLAs (see below).
