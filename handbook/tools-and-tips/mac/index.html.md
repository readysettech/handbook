This page lists various tips and tools for macOS.

## macOS tips

Here are some useful [tips](https://support.apple.com/explore/new-to-mac) if you are new to macOS.
Even if you are not new, these [keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) may come in handy.

If you are switching from Windows to macOS, these [tips](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204216) may be useful.

## Taking screenshots and videos

On a macOS, there are a few screen shot key shortcuts that can be very helpful:

* `command + shift + 3` - takes a screen shot of your entire screen(s - it will create an image for each screen you have)
* `command + shift + 4` - allows you to select an area on the screen to take a screen shot (it will create one image of your selected are)
* `command + shift + 5` - brings up a tool that allows you to do all of these things as well as create a video (with audio) of all or part of your screen.

In the case of `command + shift + 3` and `command + shift + 4`, if you also hold your control key (so, `command + shift + contol + 3`), your screen shot will be in your clipboard which means you can paste it with `command + v` in a lot of applications.

If you have a screen shot in your clipboard, you can open the `Preview` and then create an image from the clipboard using the `File -> New from clipboard`.

For screen recordings, you can use Quicktime Player to capture an area or the full screen.
Open the application and, under the `File` menu, select `New Screen Recording`, or press `command + control + n`.

## Disabling macOS notification center

During a presentation or screen share, you might want to disable your notifications on macOS to prevent distractions or possible embarrassment.

The Notification Center can be quickly disabled by Option-Clicking the menu bar icon in the top right of your screen.
This disables notifications until the next day.
Option-Click again to re-enable immediately.
Alternatively, click on the Notification Center icon, then scroll _up_ to reveal the "Do Not Disturb" toggle.

If your laptop is a MacBook with a Touch Bar, note that you can assign a handy "Do Not Disturb" button on your Control Strip.
In System Preferences, navigate to Keyboard settings and click "Customize Control Strip..." to add this.

## Locking your screen

### On your macOS menu bar

1. Click on the Apple logo  menu
1. Click “Lock Screen”

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `⌃+⌘+Q` (`ctrl+cmd+Q`).

### On your macOS Touch Bar

1. Open `System Preferences > Keyboard`
1. Click `Customize Control Strip…`
1. Drag the `Screen Lock` icon to the Touch Bar
1. Done!

### With Alfred

With enabling [Alfred](/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#alfred) and e.g. replacing Spotlight's `Cmd + Space` shortcut, you can do speedy locking with your keyboard:

1. Press `Cmd + Space`.
1. Type in `lock`. After repeating this for a while, you can just type `l`.
1. `Enter` to lock the screen.

## Keeping your Mac awake

There are some great app-based solutions that will keep your Mac awake listed in the [macOS utilities](#macos-utilities) table below, but there’s also a really simple built-in way to do this:

```shell
> caffeinate -dis
```

The options being used here are `-d` to prevent the display from sleeping, `-i` to prevent the system from idle sleeping, and `-s` to prevent the system from sleeping when running on AC power. Running the `caffeinate` command like this will just start a never ending process in your Terminal that you can later `ctrl+c` (`⌃+c`) to exit, allowing the system and displays to sleep once again. You can also set a timeout (in seconds) with the `-t` option to automatically exit the `caffeinate` command at some later time. For example, to prevent the system or displays from sleeping for 1 hour, you can run:

```shell
> caffeinate -dist 3600
```
