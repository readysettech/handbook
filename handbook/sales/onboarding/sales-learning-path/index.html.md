### 13. Integrations (SA, TAM, and PSE Only)
* **Category Overview**
   - GitLab's vision is to be the best single application for every part of the DevOps toolchain. However, some customers use tools other than our built-in features–and we respect those decisions. The Integrations category was created specifically to better serve those customers. Currently, GitLab offers [30+ project services](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/project_services.html#project-services) that integrate with a variety of external systems. Integrations are a high priority for GitLab, and the Integrations category was established to develop and maintain these integrations with key 3rd party systems and services.
* **Jira**
   - GitLab Issues are a powerful tool for discussing ideas and planning and tracking work. However, many organizations have been using Jira for these purposes and have extensive data and business processes built into it. While you can always migrate content and process from Jira to GitLab Issues, you can also opt to continue using Jira and use it together with GitLab through our [integration.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/jira.html) For a video demonstration of integration with Jira, watch [GitLab workflow with Jira issues and Jenkins pipelines.](https://youtu.be/Jn-_fyra7xQ)
* **Jenkins**
   - GitLab’s [Jenkins integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jenkins.html) allows you to trigger a Jenkins build when you push code to a repository, or when a merge request is created. Additionally, it shows the pipeline status on merge request widgets and on the project’s home page. Videos are also available on [GitLab workflow with Jira issues and Jenkins pipelines](https://youtu.be/Jn-_fyra7xQ) and [Migrating from Jenkins to GitLab.](https://youtu.be/RlEVGOpYF5Y)
* **Github**
   - GitLab provides an integration for updating the pipeline statuses on GitHub. This is especially useful if using GitLab for CI/CD only. This project integration is separate from the [instance wide GitHub integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html#mirroring-and-pipeline-status-sharing) and is automatically configured on [GitHub import.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/github.html)
*  **GitLab as OAuth 2 Authentication Service Provider (Material - GitLab Docs - 60 minutes)**
   -OAuth provides to client applications a ‘secure delegated access’ to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. In fact, OAuth allows an authorization server to issue access tokens to third-party clients with the approval of the resource owner, or the end-user.
   -Review this page to learn how to use [GitLab as an OAuth authentication service provider](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)
