## Overview 
To support and scale GitLab’s continued growth and success, the Field Enablement Team is developing a  certification program for Solutions Architects that includes functional, soft skills, and technical training for field team members.  

Certification badges will align to the customer journey and critical “Moments That Matter” (MTMs) as well as the [field functional competencies](/handbook/sales/training/field-functional-competencies/) that address the critical knowledge, skills, role-based behaviors, processes, content, and tools to successfully execute each MTM.

## Solutions Architects Curriculum 
The below slide shows the holistic learner journey for SAs and provides context for the information included throughout the learning program.

## Delivering Value-Driven Demos Learning Path  
This is the first learning path in development for SAs which will consist of 5 courses. The learning objectives for each course are outlined below.

**Course 1: Gather the Technical Requirements through Discovery** 
* Review Customer Requirements document prepared by SDR and SAL
* Perform high-level technical discovery call with customer 

**Course 2: Prepare for the Customer Demo** 
* Analyze the updated requirements from the customer collected during discovery 
* Prepare a pre-demo questionnaire
* Build the customer demo 
* Conduct a demo dry run 

**Course 3: Conduct the Customer Demo** 
* Demonstrate GitLab features, value, propositions, and workflows 
* Present compelling information in a  relevant, tailored, and logical way 

**Course 4: Update Documentation after the Demo** 
* Review and update customer requirements 

*Note: Commercial SAs will have a light-weight version of these modules*

## Recognition
Upon completing each course, the associate will receive a badge.
