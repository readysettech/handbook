Small and Medium Size Business Account Executives "SMB AE" act as Account Executives and the face of GitLab for SMB prospects and customers. They are the primary point of contact for companies that employ between [1 to 99 employees](/handbook/business-ops/resources/#segmentation). These GitLab team members are responsible for working new business in their territory as well as handling the customer journey for new and existing customers. SMB Account Executives will assist prospects through their GitLab evaluation and buying process and will be the customer's point of contact for any renewal and expansion discussions.

### Onboarding 
The goal of [onboarding](/handbook/sales/commercial/enablement) in all of this is to ensure that you feel confident and comfortable to hit the ground running. Our hope is that along this journey you are not only gaining the tactical skills needed to complete your job, but that you form connections with colleagues, gain a strong understanding of the GitLab culture, and begin to develop industry knowledge.

### Required 7 
All team members from Commercial Sales are expected to implement the [Required 7](/handbook/sales/commercial/#required-7) into their sales process. None of the 7 should be missing at any time. The Required 7 will help to stay on top of your territory, deliver what is promised to the prospect / customer and have quality meetings.

True-ups are conversations that often come to the table with customers during renewal conversations. It's important to get yourself familiar with the term, how true-ups work - and how the SMB team is handling true-up conversations:

* Who is your point of contact (title, who do they report to, role & responsibility)
* Why GitLab
* Initiatives or goals
* Stage & next steps (Why) 

**Team questions, input & critiques**
* Goal: find an original risk (What risks do we see, how can we mitigate them, how can we pre-emptively ask about these risks)
* Who is not involved? (How can we get them involved?)

**Meeting etiquette**
1. Be Respectful, though challenging
2. Be confrontational, though constructive
3. Be curious, and ask the question behind the question
4. Be committed
5. Everyone is encouraged to contribute
6. Everyone must present

### Resources
*  [Recommended books for SMB team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19KOw5A84uUvKLBI9zdspbGpP4t3OOqsQLLKj6eTBjFw/edit) 

*  [International G-drive with recordings of team meetings / trainings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ADQKNz5y48VuUk9PVA)

### Compensation
*  The global SMB team is measured monthly on shared [quota](/handbook/sales/commissions/#quotas-overview) attainment. All [iACV](/handbook/sales/#incremental-annual-contract-value-iacv) goes toward the global *shared quota* retirement.
*  Because SMB AEs operate as individual contributors toward a shared quota, [collaboration](/handbook/people-group/collaboration-and-effective-listening/#collaboration) is key. One teammate's success is everyone's success.

#### [Payment Schedule](/handbook/finance/payroll/#pay-date): 
*  AMER: [commissions](/handbook/sales/commissions/#base-commission-rate-bcr) based on prior month attainment are paid on the 2nd payroll cycle the following month.
*  EMEA & APAC: commission payout dates are specific to the country of residency. 
* you can find your adjusted payout statement and submit inquiries via [CaptivateIQ](captivateiq.com).

Any further questions related to SMB Compensation can be directed to the slack channel #total-rewards or your direct manager.

### Handbook Mantra 
GitLab is intentional about documenting in a manner that creates a single source of truth. [It operates handbook-first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/), and in valuing transparency, makes its handbook publicly accessible to all. SMB team members should always be striving to contribute and exemplify this value.
