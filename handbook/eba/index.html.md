## EBA Team Best Practices

### Suggested formats for calendar invites within Executive Group (E-Group)
* MTG for meetings in person, either at Mission Control or another location
* INTERVIEW for media interviews (make sure to loop in our PR partner)
* CALL for phone calls or conference calls
* VIDEOCALL for video conference calls using Zoom
  * Example: “VIDEOCALL Jane Doe for Executive Assistant” or "VIDEOCALL Jane Doe (GitLab) & Sid Sijbrandij (GitLab)""
* LIVESTREAM for livestreams
  * When a meeting is being live-streamed to YouTube add Public Stream or Private Stream in the subject and body of the calendar invite to indicate which live stream
* A candidate interview will include the work interview using regular casing.
* 1:1 for one-on-ones with direct reports
  * Example: "1:1 Jane Doe & Sid"
* "Skip Level" should be in the title of skip level meetings
* Flight travel should include "flight" in the title
* Ground transportation is indicated by "Uber", "Ground Transportation", or "Car service" in the title
* Executive time should be labeled "Exec Time" or "Executive Time"
* Please utilize the [Zoom plugin for Google Calendar](/handbook/communication/#video-calls) to schedule Zoom meetings on behalf of E-Group
* Please add the subject of the call in the description, for internal and external calls.
* All external meetings RSVP should be confirmed with the guests at least 24hrs in advance
* When meetings are being rescheduled please add RESCHEDULING in the subject line of the calendar invite to indicate the reschedule and change the RSVP to "No"


When sending a calendar invite for an in-person meeting at Mission Control, please make sure to include the following items in the calendar invite:

1. Calendar blurb
1. Cell numbers (in case of an in-person meeting)
1. Mission Control Access Instructions (when meeting at Mission Control)

### General scheduling guidelines

* For meetings spanning across multiple time zones and with external parties, [Time & Date Calculator](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html) can help determine the best time to schedule
* When scheduling internally with multiple attendee's, please utilize Google [calendars](https://calendar.google.com)[Find a Time feature](https://gsuitetips.com/tips/calendar/find-a-time-in-google-calendar/) to see when GitLab team-members are free to schedule a meeting with. Please be cognizant of people time zones. If in doubt, please reach out to the team member directly in slack
* When researching flights, consider using a tool like [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com) or [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights?hl=en) to explore options for flights
* Schedule calls in European timezones in the morning (am) Pacific (Daylight) Time and US time zones in the afternoon (pm) Pacific (Daylight) Time
* Holds on the schedule should be removed at least 60 minutes before the preceding meeting starts. Preferably 24hr in advance of the meeting when possible
* Meetings should be scheduled for 25 minutes or 50 minutes.  As a general guideline meetings should not be scheduled to the full 30/60 minute mark
* If the call is with any Google company, use Hangouts instead of Zoom.
* For meetings at Mission Control and another guest joining via video call: The EBA will schedule an additional ten minutes before the appointment to test the zoom room system.
* For meetings or lunch/dinner appointments, always make sure to add the address in the invite of the location where it’s scheduled.
* Make sure to plan travel time (in a separate calendar item, just for the exec) before and after the meeting in case another meeting or call should follow.
* After each meeting with a potential investor, make sure to update Airtable with the information on these meetings.

### Travel

EBAs research the best option for a flight and book it according to their executive's schedule. If the Executive requires approving the flights beforehand, please follow that process before booking.
Make sure to add a calendar item for 2 hours before take off for check in and add a separate one for travel time before that in the exec's calendar.
If a flight was changed or not taken due to delays or other circumstances, make sure to check with the airline for the current flight status.

### Expensify
* When you’re logged in, you can find wingman account access for other team members in the top right corner menu.
* Check their email (if you have access), using the search bar in the top, to find any receipts for the postings in the current expense report.
* And/or write down what receipts are missing and email to request them if needed.

### Zoom
* Request Schedule Privilege for executives by having the executive go to their Zoom profile settings and scrolling down to the **Schedule Privilege** section. The executive will need to  click the plus button icon to add the EBA's email address to the **Assign Scheduling Privilege** pop-up box. 
  * This setting will allow EBAs to create meetings using the user's One-time Meeting ID.
* To add yourself as an alternative host to a meeting, click on your profile and select **Meetings** from the header. Find the meeting you'd like to be an alternative host for, and click on the meeting title. Scroll to the bottom and select, **Edit this Meeting**. Scroll to the bottom and add yourself and/or others as **Alternative Hosts**. 
  * This will allow you access to additional meeting settings such as Mute All, Unmute All, Play Enter/Exit Chime, Mute Participants on Entry, Record, End Meeting, and more. 

### Google Groups
To view members of Google Groups, reference the [gsuite group member repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/security-tools/report-gsuite-group-members/-/tree/master). A sync is run on the repository every hour, as noted in the README.md file. 

### Company Mail
 The mail is forwarded weekly to the CFO's Sr. EBA and will be distributed accordingly.
* Mail addressed to Sytse 'Sid' Sijbrandij - contact the Staff Executive Business Admin to CEO for next steps.
* Incoming checks for deposit - scan and email to the PAO, Controller, Director of Revenue and Sr. Billing Manager; then send for deposit.
* Mail from Comerica - scan and email to the Controller and Sr. Billing Manager.
* Mail addressed to Legal - contact the CLO for next steps.
* Mail related to tax documents - scan and email to the PAO, Director of Tax and Controller.
* Mail related to employment, payroll, workers compensation, court orders, unemployment - mail to designated Payroll Specialiast.
* Mail addressed to AP - scan and email to ap@gitlab.com. 
* All human resources related documents will be sent to a designated team member on the People Group Team.
* The Sr. EBA to the CFO is responsible for all remaining mail, which will be dispersed accordingly to specific individuals. 
* More information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwaqZpivB2b7tozZNV6iaFzIpNePIM4HsLbk62Ym0lQ/edit#).

### E-Group In-person Meetings

There should be one invite for all attendees that includes the following:

* Exact meeting time blocked (ie: Start at 9am PST, End at 5pm PST)
* Zoom Link for remote participants
* Agenda (the agenda should also include the zoom link at the top)
* Notes doc shared via calendar invite and sharing set to "can edit" for those attending the meeting

## Public engagement

The public process does two things: allows others to benefit from the conversation and it acts as a filter since there is only a limited amount of time so we should prioritize conversations that a wider audience can benefit from.

### OKRs
* EBA to the CEO to assist in maintaining and scheduling meetings revolving around the [OKR updating process](/company/okrs/#updating).

## Performance Indicators (PI)

### Leadership SAT Survey

On a quarterly basis, any Executive at GitLab that has dedicated administrative support via an Executive Business Administrator will receieve a survey with a series of questions and a rating scale of 1-5 (5 being excellent) to determine the performance of the EBA team.

Sample Questions:
* Tasks are completed within agreed timeframes, to accurately meet requirements and consistent with GitLab’s policies and procedures.
* EBA responds to queries in a timely manner based on the urgency of the request
* EBA knows and keeps Executive(s) informed of all activities and appointments at all times.
* EBA interacts and communicates clearly with key stakeholders both internally and externally through completion of tasks with little direction
* EBA proactively seeks feedback on the quality of administrative support and demonstrates an approach of continuous improvement


## Scheduling preferences for Sid Sijbrandij, Co-founder and CEO

* All meetings on Sid's calendar should be scheduled and vetted by the EBA to the CEO. Please do not directly schedule a meeting onto Sid's calendar without confirming with the EBA to the CEO in advance.  
* Meetings before 7:30am and after 6pm Pacific require Sid's approval before scheduling. Please reach out to him in slack to approve. 
* Don't schedule over the Weekly E-group call unless approved by Sid
* When our CLO requests a meeting it will always override other meetings that are scheduled if urgent
* Mark the events listed in [Google Calendar section](/handbook/communication/#google-calendar) of the handbook as 'Private'
* The [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/187Q355Q4IvrJ-uayVamoQmh0aXZ6eixAOE90jZspAY4/edit?ts=574610db&pli=1) of items to be handled by Sid's EA
* **All** holds on Sid's calendar need a reason so he can judge when the hold might no longer apply.
* Monthly video calls are 25 minutes while quarterly calls/dinners are scheduled for 90 minutes plus any necessary travel time.
* Follow up on introductions from certain recipients (board, investors) immediately without asking for approval.
* If Sid is meeting with a candidate, partner with recruiting to send the calendar invite through Greenhouse.
* If Sid has an external meeting and the location is less than 25 minutes away on foot, he would prefer to walk. Please ensure the calendar reflects that he is walking versus driving/uber/lyft.
* If Sid has a **ride or walks** to an appointment, make sure to **add 5 minutes extra** to find the address and sign in at reception.
* If Sid is **driving himself**, make sure to **add 15 minutes extra** for random occurrences such as traffic, stopping for gas or parking.
* If Sid is **driving himself** to a meeting, he likes to plan phone calls to catch up with the team. Check with him who he'd like to talk with during his commute and schedule accordingly or post in #ceo channel in slack offering a call with Sid our team members.
* Due to a busy schedule Sid has a preference of meeting setup: First try for a video call or a meeting at Mission Control. If the other party presses to meet at their location, confirm if that is OK before accepting.
* Sales meetings are important. If the CEO can help the process, feel free to include him in the meeting by working with the EBA to CEO on this. Please include the sales rep and solutions architect in this meeting. The person requesting the meeting should provide a meeting brief document to the EBA at the time of their request to schedule. 
* Prep calls for Sales meeting should be scheduled for 10 minutes by default. A [Customer Briefing Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hyA12EN5iEwApAr_g4_-vhUQZohKxm5xkX9xxZ1JNog/edit?usp=sharing) needs to be provided by the Sales team member requesting the meeting in order to schedule with the CEO.
* Office hours hosted by the CEO like Iteration Office Hours should be live streamed publicly by default and the live stream should be hosted by a member of the EBA team or a CEO Shadow. 
* If there is a video posted in advance of a [Group Conversation](/handbook/people-group/group-conversations/) in slack, the EBA to the CEO should schedule a meeting at 6am (Pacific time) on the CEO's calendar for him to watch the video in advance of the Group Conversation on the same day. Please include a link to the video in the calendar invite. 

### CEO Email Management

* Labels: `/archive`, `/read-respond`, `/personal` 
* Emails that need the CEO's attention should be "starred" versus labeled
* EBA to CEO should prepare draft responses
* EBA to CEO should proactively schedule meetings requested via e-mail
* Standard reply for recruiters:
“We do not accept solicitations by recruiters, recruiting agencies, headhunters, and outsourcing organizations. Please find all info [on our jobs page](/jobs/#no-recruiters)."


### Travel preferences
Current preferences for flights are:
* Aisle seat
* Check a bag for all trips longer than one night
* Frequent Flyer details of all (previously flown) airlines are in EA vault of 1Password as well as important passport/visa info

### CEO Evangelism and External Speaking Engagements 

### Process
* An issue is created in the Corporate Marketing project [using the label of `ceo-evangelism`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=ceo-evangelism) and assigned to the Sr. Corporate Communications Manager, Executive Communications and EBA to the CEO. 
* Where there is content alignment, the Corporate Communications team provides the thesis of the talk along with an outline in slide deck form
* The DRI collaborates on this thesis and outline and then presents it to the Exec for approval
* The DRI takes over slide deck creation with design support from our Design team or PR firm as necessary (one week lead time needed to acquire their resources)

### Example talks

* Open Core Business Models
* Multicloud Maturity Model
* Remote Work/ The Future of Work

### Content Review

* The EBA to the Exec is responsible for scheduling an initial set of practice sessions with the content DRI, the Exec, and a developer evangelism team member. It is the EBA's discretion based on experience with the Exec and their speaking engagements in the past to decide how many times to set up.
* The call attendees are responsible to communicate with the EBA if they need more or less sessions ASAP

As a rule of thumb, there should be 1 slide per minute of expected speech delivery.

The initial content review for the CEO should be in bullet points only.
Then the CEO can talk through the slides and a team member can capture the CEO's tone of voice as he talks through the talk.
This helps ensure the talk track is in the CEO's voice.

The Chief of Staff is responsible for making sure that all of the CEO's Evangelism engagements are on our events page by updating the [events.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/events.yml) file.

### Pick Your Brain meetings

If people want advice on open source, remote work, or other things related to GitLab we'll consider that. If Sid approves of the request we suggest the following since we want to make sure the content is radiated as widely as possible. To start, we send an email as shown below.

> Thanks for being interested in GitLab. If we schedule a meeting it will follow GitLab's [Pick Your Brain format](/handbook/ceo/#pick-your-brain-interviews). Are you able to submit a draft post with us within 48 hours of interview?

1. Read and watch [past Pick Your Brain interviews](/company/culture/all-remote/interviews/#pick-your-brain-interviews), including [one hosted by Slab co-founder Jason Chen](/blog/2016/07/14/building-an-open-source-company-interview-with-gitlabs-ceo/) that reached [the top spot on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12615723).

Reply to emails: Thanks for wanting to chat. I propose we meet in the format proposed in GitLab's [Handbook](#pick-your-brain-meetings) so that other people benefit from our conversation too. If you're up for that please work with Cheri (cc:) to schedule. 

Please note, requests for meeting about remote work, all-remote efforts, distributed workforces, etc should be scheduled with the Head of Remote versus Sid when possible.


### Scheduling Pick Your Brain meetings

1. Once Pick Your Brain meetings are confirmed, schedule a Zoom Webinar and send out a calendar invite to all guests and make sure to add a separate calendar invite for Sid with preparation time. [Scheduling a Zoom webinar](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000350446-Streaming-a-Webinar-on-YouTube-Live)
