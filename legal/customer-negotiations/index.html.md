## Completing Vendor Request Forms

**It is the sales team member responsibility to complete Vendor Request Forms**

**Included on the Company Information Page is:**
- Address / information related to each GitLab entity
- All banking information
- ECCN Number
- NAICS Code
- Dun and Bradstreet Number
...AND VARIOUS OTHER DETAILS
- W9 is located on the Finance [Forms page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/#forms)
- Request Insurance Certificate on [Legal Team Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/#4-requests-for-insurance-certificate)

2.  If there are questions / elements that are not found in the Company Information Page, the Sales Rep should engage Deal Desk to organize requests of finance and tax. Information regarding contacting Deal Desk and overall process can be found at the [Sales Order Process Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#how-to-process-customer-requested-vendor-setup-forms)

3. **ONLY OPEN A LEGAL REQUEST IF:** There is a specific legal question / element being requested within the Vendor Form.

Example: Has GitLab, or board member / executed of GitLab, been subject to a lawsuit? 

 
**As a private company, we will not share the following information in a Vendor Request Form:** 
- Stock / Share ownership of the company
- Finances, including annual and/or historical performance

## When does GitLab negotiate
### ðŸŽ¥ [Watch When does GitLab Negotiate Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYvZKP5OohA)
*Learn about when GitLab negotiates; Where to find an NDA template; 3:20 (Log into GitLab Unfiltered)*

1. GitLab will negotiate NDAs with our prospects. You can always send the prospect the GitLab NDA template found [here](/handbook/legal/#contract-templates) and ask for them to sign. If they want to use their template, simply open a Legal Request for "Contract Review".
2. GitLab will negotiate changes to our terms and conditions provided the [current] Opportunity is greater than $25K (USD).
3. GitLab will negotiate using a Customer terms and conditions-if they are applicable to our Software and business-if the [current] Opportunity is greater than $100K (USD).
4. **Why don't we negotiate with all Customers?** Using resources to negotiate on all deals would not be a good use of GitLab resources and instead, we created our terms to be reasonable and in line with industry standards which allows us to place our resources into creating better products and services.
