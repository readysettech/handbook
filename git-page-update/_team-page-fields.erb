Search for a placeholder entry with your first or preferred name and last name and update your profile information
(make sure you are searching within the file you want to edit by clicking on the file first).
If you don't find the entry, copy/paste another team member's entry and place it at the end of the page.
  * Update your `name` if needed to your `FirstName LastName`or `PreferredName LastName`
  * Verify your title.
    * If your position title is incorrect or not filled in, navigate to the job_families.yml and use command+F to search for your job title.
  * Verify `reports_to` lists your manager using the `slug` value from their team page entry.
  * If you are a manager, verify if the `reports_to` of your direct reports are referring to your `slug`
  * Add the filename of your profile picture making sure to match exactly even letter case. Ensure to delete "../gitlab-logo-extra-whitespace.png", if present. Completed line should look like this "picture: yournameinlowercase.jpg".
  * Add your Twitter and GitLab handles without the leading `@`.
  * Add your pronouns.
  * Change your locality to your city and state, province, region.
  * Add your own `story`. Use other team member's stories as a reference.
  * If remote work has [changed your life](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/people/) in a meaningful way, consider adding your own `remote_story`, using other team member remote stories as a [reference](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/uploads/8161ceac4523a9f36244f9533960ccbd/remote-story-example.png).
  * Update any data that was filled in but is incorrect

  **Important:** Do not use the `tab` character and respect the spaces between lines otherwise the page format will break. Note that referenced file names/extensions are case sensitive, and a file which is not found will cause a pipeline failure.
