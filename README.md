# ReadySet Technology Company Handbook

## About the handbook

The ReadySet team handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. It is our way of ensuring that all of our company information was accessible to everyone regardless of when they became part of the team. We established the handbook because we saw these benefits:

1. Reading is much faster than listening.
1. Reading is async, you don't have to interrupt someone or wait for them to become available.
1. Retention is better if people know what they are getting into before they join.
1. On-boarding is easier if you can find all relevant information spelled out.
1. Teamwork is easier if you can read how other parts of the company work.
1. Discussing changes is easier if you can read what the current process is.

Most guidelines in this handbook are meant to help, and unless otherwise stated, are meant to help more than being absolute rules. Don't be afraid to do something because you don't know the entire handbook, nobody does. Be gentle when reminding people about these guidelines. For example say, "It is not a problem, but next time please consider the following guideline from the handbook."
