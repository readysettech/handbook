Any exceptions must be confirmed by the Staff EBA to the CEO before shipping.

### Agenda

1. Prior to distributing the Board deck, the CoS groups questions together in the agenda by function. Questions can be added to the agenda up to 24 hours before the meeting starts. After this point, the agenda will be locked. Notes *should not* be taken by Shadows or GitLab team members in the agenda during the meeting.
1. Key Board material is presented during Board Meetings. This includes:
   * Departamental deep dives
   * The core Board deck (excluding the appendix or any pre-read slides)
   * The Administrative Session for Board Committee readouts by the Committee Chairperson updating the Board as to the Committee’s activities and highlighting the items requiring Board approval, if any. 5 to 8 minutes will be allocated for this.
1. Questions can be asked throughout presentations, but 30 minutes at the end will be allocated just for discussion.
1. After the General Session of the Board Meeting, there is then an "Administrative Session" attended by the CFO, CLO, and the full Board (along with Observers).
1. At the conclusion of the Administrative Session the CFO and CLO depart and the full Board shall meet for a Closed Session.

### Board Deck

1. The deck should start with a list of up to ten [GitLab KPIs](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/kpi-index/#gitlab-kpis). These should reflect the team’s prioritizations. The expectation is that these metrics will be on the list for a year or longer.
1. The deck should highlight 3 key asks for Board input within the meeting. Each ask should have a few key slides that provide historical context, current status, and plans for the future. At least 30 minutes should be spent in this section.
1. The deck will include one slide that provides an overview of the competitive landscape and another slide that identifies GitLab's top 3 R&D investments.
1. The deck should not exceed 10 slides per individual function, unless the function is scheduled to provide a deep dive.
1. Each E-Group member may include 1 additional slide with their asks of the Board.
1. Slides should convey a high-level overview as opposed to operational updates and should not include embedded links.
1. Put information on public webpages such as [/strategy](/company/strategy/) as much as possible.
1. Sensitive information goes into the Administrative deck managed by the CFO.
1. Font size should be minimum 16pt, footnotes excluded. We want to make sure everything can be read.
1. Every slide should have a title which provides the key takeaway from that slide. 

### CEO Video and Memo

The CEO is responsible for submitting both a memo and a video to the BoD in advance of the Board meeting. The memo should be 1.5-2 pages capturing the highlights across the organization for the quarter. The video should be in the style of an earnings call to give a general overview of what is and is not working. The CoS will upload the video to YouTube as an unlisted video and ensure both the video and the memo get distributed to the Board with the other materials.

### Deep Dives

Functions with deep dives can have slides that are functionally focused and not directly related to other key topics covered in the rest of the core deck. 
Deep dives are covered in the core deck presentation and follow up Q&A.

There will be two deep dives on the agenda for each board meeting:

1. 30 minutes allotted to a single functional area on a rotational basis

The functional deep dive rotation schedule is as follows:

- Product management and product strategy (2020-06)
- Finance (2020-09)
- Legal (2020-12)
- Engineering (2021-03)
- Sales (2021-06)
- Marketing (2021-09)
- People (2021-12)

Functional deep dives cover the following:

- Highlights over the last quarter (how we got here)
    - Additional details on each highlight
- Major wins (in case there's anything worth mentioning that is a win, but might not be a highlight)
- Key challenges
    - Additional details on each key challenge

#### Sales Slides

1. An overview of segment and geographic success

The Finance slides are as follows:

1. Review past quarter and YTD: Bookings review (growth rates) / new/growth and by sales zone

## Executive Stable Counterparts

Every GitLab Executive has a [Stable Counterpart](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/library/organization/stable-counterparts/). From time to time throughout the year, Executives and Board members may meet informally with the goal of building relationships and continuing a dialogue outside of quarterly  Board meetings. These informal conversations may be 1:1 or in small groups.

## Quarterly AMA with the Board

We will have one Board member per quarter conduct an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with the GitLab team.  AMA’s are 25 minutes and live streamed to GitLab Unfiltered on YouTube. These AMA's are scheduled by the Staff EBA to the CEO.

## Board Selection Process

### Roles and Responsibilities

### Interview Process

#### Independent

1. CEO and Board members: 50-minute meetings.
1. GitLab CRO, CFO, CLO and other E-Group members as requested.

## Board Renewal Process

Assuming GitLab adopts a three class structure, a Director can belong to Class I, Class II or Class III. Some of our Directors will be in Class 1 and will be up for reelection as early as the first year the company is public, while other Directors will not be up for reelection until 2 or 3 years after the company is public. The decision as to which director is in which class is typically made close to when a company goes public. Various factors in making this determination are taken into consideration; for example, some VC Directors may prefer to leave the Board earlier in the public company lifecycle due to the number of commitments or requirements imposed by their respective funds.
