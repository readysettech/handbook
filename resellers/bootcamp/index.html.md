# GitLab Partner Bootcamp

GitLab Partner Bootcamp is here to help you get up to speed on implementing GitLab for your customers.

It is designed to be a self paced training where you can learn about and practice most common usecases and scenarios.

Bootcamp material is divided into sections:
1. Introduction to GitLab
2. Using GitLab
3. Implementing GitLab

These sections are independent, so you can take any of them in any order depending on your needs; we recommend starting with the "Using GitLab" and moving on to "Implementing GitLab"

## Introduction to GitLab
GitLab is a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. To see what GitLab does have a look at this demo video.

### GitLab Basics for Developers 
If you're brand new to GitLab, we recommend watching this video to get familiar with the basics of the development workflow

## Using GitLab

### How to start?

1. The Lab exercises are defined as individual issues within [this GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/technical-bootcamp/using-gitlab);
2. This project also includes instructions on how to create your own copy of the project, as well as details of the Coffee Shop project that you will use as part of the Lab exercises.  Please refer to the instructions and carry out the necessary actions to create your Lab environment.
3. Having completed the above, move to the next section on Agile Project Management. This will help you with the knowledge required to then configure your Bootcamp Lab environment


### Agile Project Management

**Now go to your imported Labs project, find the issue called *Lab 0* and assign it to yourself. It contains all steps needed to set up the environment for the future labs. Execute all tasks in the issue.**

## Implementing GitLab

### How to Start?

1. You will require access to a cloud hosting provider such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform or similar, in order to provision virtual machines and kubernetes clusters as part of the lab excercises. 
2. Certain Bootcamp Labs take advantage of paid Enterprise tier features; to get the full experience your instance of GitLab should be licensed to Ultimate
    * [Get a trial here](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/). 
3. The Lab exercises are defined as individual issues within [this GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/technical-bootcamp/implementing-gitlab)
