## Enterprise Application Ecosystem

tier one applications of lead to fulfillment

### Customers application

- This application is where the customer logs in to manage their account details for their subscription
- The customers application also sends and receives data to and from other applications like: Zuora, Salesforce, GitLab.com, and the license application.
- GitLab created and manages the customers application.
- Additionally, there are two other points of sale online: via the [AWS marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=9657c703-ca56-4b54-b029-9ded0fadd970) and [GOV.UK Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/526446644571793).

## System Integrations Requirements

- API should send country codes ISO 2 from Customers application or GitLab.com forms to SFDC and Marketo
- [Required fields](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3627) for submitting new leads to Marketo in order for them to be properly rotated to the sales team.

  Zuora Communication Profiles
</summary>

- Communication Profiles:
    - New accounts are set to `Default Profile`
    - `Silent Profile` is used temporarily when the customer should not receive notifications.
        _note: this would prevent the system from making the license available in the customers application._

  Zuora: relationship between billing batches and auto-renew
</summary>

- Batch1: Web Direct
- Batch2: Sales assisted
- Batch3: Auto-Renewal
- Batch4: Reseller
- Batch5: EDU/OSS

Billing batches support more optimization of billing functions in Zuora.

Auto-renew functionality is distinct from billing batches.
_Auto-renew in the customers application must be set by the customer and functionality in the customers application is distinct from the functionality in Zuora._

- SaaS purchases in the customers application default is `auto-renew=true`
- if a customer cancels their subscription, `auto-renew` toggles to `false`
- in Zuora, subscriptions default to `auto-renew=true`
- for sales assisted deals, the billing team manually sets `auto-renew=false`, but the customer can change it to `auto-renew=true` from the customers application

<summary markdown='span'>
  Zuora Entities
</summary>

- All web direct accounts are sent to GitLab, Inc. (US) entity for initial purchase.
    If a deal moves to sales assisted for any reason, we then create an account manually on the correct entity if it differs from US.

The defaults are related to the address delineating the entity based on the location of the customer.
Country specification is unrelated to a close process.
Note that the GitLab entity information will be populated via the following rules.
This table is based on the ISO-2 billing country code of the direct customer or reseller we are delivering invoices to:

| Entity               | Direct/Unauthorized Reseller | Authorized Reseller   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| BV (Netherlands)     | NL                           | Not AU, DE, UK, or US |
| GmbH (Germany)       | DE                           | DE                    |
| Ltd (United Kingdom) | UK                           | UK                    |
| Inc (United States)  | Not AU, NL, DE, or US        | US                    |
| Pty Ltd (Australia)  | Not NL, DE, UK, or US        | AU                    |

For example:
A sales assisted customer or unauthorized reseller in the Netherlands (NL) will be billed out of GitLab BV; Germany from GitLab GmbH; United Kingdom from GitLab Ltd; any sales assisted customer outside these countries will be billed from GitLab Inc.
An authorized reseller based on Germany will be billed from GitLab GmbH; United Kingdom from GitLab Ltd; United States from GitLab Inc; any resellers based outside these countries will be billed out of GitLab BV.

## Notifications

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
  renewal mailings
</summary>

This flow diagram shows the current renewal email cadence, depending on auto-renew settings.
Note: Email content cannot currently be tailored to SaaS vs. Self-managed.
<img src="/images/growth/renewal_emails.png">

- The main difference between the flows is whether auto-renew is on or not
- The emails come from Zuora, with the exception of the "14 day SaaS auto-renew email", which is sent by the customers application
    - 14 day SaaS auto-renew email is only sent if there is an increase in the customer's seat count which will lead to an increased bill

### 90 day email

##### refunds

  When might [Billing cancel and/or downgrade a subscription](/handbook/finance/accounting/#zuora-subscription-status-active)?
</summary>

- request from the customer to have it cancelled as they don’t want to use it in the future
- customer bought the wrong number of seats and we refund due to this; we would not downgrade as we know that the customer will repurchase soon and we don’t want to cause disruption
- we need to change the entity of an account at renewal (sales assisted only).
    In this case, the subscription will be cancelled and a new one will be created under a new account.
- if credit card payment is declined for auto-renewed accounts (SaaS)

## Licensing and Renewals (L&R) Queue in Zendesk

The customers application intersects with Support, Billing, Sales, and Product primarily.
Tickets come into the L&R queue in Zendesk generally three ways, generally prioritized as low:

- by emailing [renewals@gitlab.com](mailto:renewals@gitlab.com)

- by [opening a support ticket](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=334487) and selecting `Help with my license`

- by filling out the form on the [Renewals page](https://about.gitlab.com/renewals/)
    The L&R Queue is a separate queue of Zendesk tickets that fall outside of the scope of customer product support; it's handled by Support by triaging the issue and rerouting the tickets to the appropriate team.

- **Passing to Sales:** Pass tickets relating to IACV to Sales via cc to Sales in reply to ticket which sends an email to both customer and account owner. If an account is associated with the ticket, there's a ticket object in SFDC.
    It's then Sales's responsibility to continue the customer interaction and the BSS closes the Zendesk ticket.

- **Passing to Sales:** If a ticket comes in and Support is unable to determine the account owner or the inquiry is related to new business, they reach out to the SFDC chatter group `ZD-newbusiness` where the SDR Regional leads for EMEA, APAC and AMER/LATAM provide an answer.
    Then Support cc's that person on the ticket and closes in Zendesk.
        - Regional Leads for SDRs:
            - AMER/LATAM - Mona Elliot
            - APAC - Jay Thomas-Burrows
            - EMEA - Elsje Smart

- **Passing to Billing:** The mechanism to pass tickets to the Billing team is to open the ticket, then change the field `form` from the value `Upgrades, Renewals & AR (refunds)` to `Accounts Receivable/Refunds`.
    This puts the ticket into the Billing Team's queue which they then manage.
