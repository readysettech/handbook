### Data Analysts

The Data Analyst Team operates in a hub and spoke model, where some analysts are part of the central data team (hub) while others are embedded (spoke) or distributed (spoke) throughout the organization.

**Central** - those in this role report to and have their priorities set by the Data team. They currently support those in the Distributed role, cover ad-hoc requests, and support all Departments.

**Embedded** - those in this role report to the data team but their priorities are set by their Departments.

**Distributed** - those in this role report to and have their priorities set by their Departments. However, they work closely with those in the Central role to align on data initiatives and for assistance on the technology stack.

All roles mentioned above have their MRs and dashboards reviews by members in the Data team. Both Embedded and Distributed data analyst or data engineer tend to be subject matter experts (SME) for a particular business unit.

### Data Engineers

[Data Engineer Handbook](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/organization/engineering)

Though Data Engineers are sometimes given assignments to better support business functions **no members of the data engineering team are embedded or distributed**. This allows them to focus on our data platform with an appropriate development cadence.
