<summary markdown="span">Key Discussion Points</summary>

- Our [Mission](/company/strategy/#mission) is that Everyone Can Contribute, and our most important value is [Results](/handbook/values/#results). Like we've extended that to the Handbook, we want to extend it to our Learning Materials.
- We want to leverage the best of an e-learning platform, with the benefits of reminders, interactivity, and more but make sure the materials we produce are also available to those who aren't using an e-learning platform, while fulfilling [our mission](/company/strategy/#mission).
- There are benefits to keeping our e-learning material [handbook-first](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first):
    - Folks who have already completed a formal training through an e-learning platform may want to return to the materials
    - Those who never go through the formal platform may also benefit from the materials
    - The handbook continues to be the SSOT, with the e-learning platform leveraging handbook materials through screenshots, embeds, and more

## Six Critical Questions

Inspired by _The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business_ by Patrick Lencioni

On our best day, we show up with a positive attitude while demonstrating [GitLab’s values](/handbook/values/) along with the following behaviors to overcome the [Five Dysfunctions](/handbook/values/#five-dysfunctions):

- **Trust**: Extend trust, actively listen, and assume noble intent; give and receive feedback with respect and solicit feedback often
- **Embrace Healthy Conflict**: Engage in constructive conflict for the purpose of achieving shared goals & objectives; resolve personal issues, quickly and directly
- **Commitment**: Support decisions once decisions are made with a GitLab team-first approach
- **Accountability**: Hold ourselves and each other accountable while encouraging each other & celebrating successes
- **Results**: Strong drive for results and a focus on the customer; demonstrate passion for continuous learning & improvement

## Making a Field Enablement Request

If you have a great training idea and/or enablement request, we'd love to hear it! Please make an enablement request by following this quick process:

- Submit an issue using [this issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/enablement/-/issues/new?issuable_template=field-enablement-request)
    - Please be descriptive in the issue in order to give our team the necessary context to review and prioritize your request. Note that ALL questions must be answered prior to Field Enablement triaging your request.
- Upon submitting your request, the issue will be tagged as `FE priority::new request` and `FE status::triage`
- Field Enablement will triage the request as quickly as possible. Upon examining the request, they will assess the priority and status by labeling it with one of the labels (please see label definitions in section below):
    - Priority:
        - `FE priority::1`
        - `FE priority::2`
        - `FE priority::3`
    - Status:
        - `FE status::wip`
        - `FE status::backlog`
- Field Enablement will collaborate with the requester on the request details directly in the issue to clarify any missing information, set up a discovery call, and/or update on next-steps.

If you have a Field Communications request (process change, announcement, etc.), please see the request process outlined [here](/handbook/sales/field-communications/#requesting-field-announcements).
