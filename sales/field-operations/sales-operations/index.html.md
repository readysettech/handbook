Here are the guidelines for requesting account list loads from Sales Operations.
Please follow the instructions below.
The SLA for account list loads into Salesforce is 5-7 business days.
  
**For uploading a list of net new accounts**
* We have a template you can use to dedupe a list of accounts you have sourced [here in the google drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zm4uA2_d7aj31BY2wTxNw6HoElyWJQkjMYY4e1D3tRM/edit#gid=1823098798).
This template will help you dedupe the account list and also format your list for upload into Salesforce.

## **Important Resources & Processes**

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
  Primary Quote System
</summary>

The Primary Quote system is a 1:1 relationship in SFDC that connects the total transaction amount on a quote with the amount on its related opportunity.
This is to ensure we are forecasting the same amount that we will book and enables further automation as the quote is sent to Zuora billing.
To support sales situations that require multiple quotes (for instance: a small deal option and a big deal option), sales reps can identify which one of their quote is "Primary".

[Primary Quote technical documentation here:](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-systems/gtm-technical-documentation/#primary-quote-system)

  Overdue Opportunity Process
</summary>

1. An overdue opportunity report goes out every Tuesday to managers.
1. An email alert goes out directly to the opportunity owner when the oppty is past due upon edit of the opportunity. Ex: an action needs to happen to trigger the email. 
1. Sales Operations will give until the 15th of the month and then forklift any opportunity with a close date in the past month to a future close date.
1. Managers have "over due" reports on their dashboards for review as needed.

  Salesforce Access Removal Process
</summary>

1. To ensure the appropriate users have access and that we're being fiscally responsible in terms of overall usage, users with no usage in 90 days will be deactivated. 
1. Usage will be reviewed once at the beginning of the second month of the quarter so as not to disrupt any quarter end/quarter start cadences. The dates are scheduled on the Field Ops calander.
1. An [Access Change Request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#access-change-request) will be created and an email will be sent to users as extra notification.
1. If access is needed in the future, please submit a new [Access Request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#single-person-access-request) and we can confirm if SFDC is the correct place to gather this information or if other tools can provide it.

</summary>

**Identifying the Users**

1. Check the Data in the [Provided Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aGGo): 
    * Make sure the last login date is set to LESS than or equal to 90 Days ago. 
    * Verify that no integration users or users that might be tied to an external system are not included in the access removal.  If there are questions, error on the cautious side and work with Sales Systems. 
1. Create an [Access Change Request](handbook/business-ops/employee-enablement/it-ops-team/access-requests/#access-change-request)
    * List the users that will be removed so that we have record of reason and users if needed in the future. 
1. Email Notification:
    * Work with Sales Operations Manager to send the email notification.  This is an extra step for extra visibility to users and might not always be needed depending on volume and other communication that has occured. 
    * Example Email:
    
        Hope that you are having a good week.  We in SalesOps are doing a cleanup of our tech stack tools to ensure the appropriate users have access and that we're being fiscally responsible in terms of overall usage.  During this process, we've discovered that nearly **XXX** Salesforce.com users haven't logged in for 3 months or more.  If you're receiving this message, your user account falls into this bucket. 
        As such, I'm writing to let you know that we'll be deactivating your SFDC license on XXX in an effort to ensure that we have enough licenses to provision to our new and existing Sales people; who leverage the tool daily. 
        So what does this mean for you?  
        Effective XXX you will no longer have access to SFDC
        If there's critical SFDC data that you need for your role, please submit a new Access Request and we can confirm if SFDC is the correct place to gather this information or if other tools can provide it
        Please let me know if you have any questions.

1. Deactivating Users in Salesforce
    * From Salesforce, access the setup menu and then manager users.  
    * Locate the user and uncheck the Active box, or click the Freeze button.  Freeze should only be used if the user can not be fully deactivated due to impact to other system or process. 
    * If a user is frozen set a reminder in an issue to go back and deactivate user once related systems / process have been udpated.

## **Sales Operations Sponsored Dashboards and Maintenance**

The Sales Operations team has sponsored a comprehensive but consumable "Reporting Package" (via SFDC Dashboards) with validated (SalesOps approved) metrics to the Account Executives.
This list will continue to evolve and will be maintained during the onboarding and offboarding process.
In addition to sponsored reporting, Sales Ops will maintain existing reports by archiving or deleting any report or dashboard not used in 180 days.

## **Sales Operations Go To Market**

### **Account Ownership Rules of Engagement**

[Account Ownership Rules of Engagement Handbook](/handbook/business-ops/resources/#account-ownership-rules-of-engagement)

### **Sales Territories**

[Sales Territories](/handbook/sales/territories/)

### **Territory Success Planning (TSP)**

TSP is an automated process workflow intended to properly segment & route Salesforce accounts to the correct Sales territory & respective owner.
This clarifies who should own which accounts & reduces current Ops overhead to manage manually.
TSP fields are designed to be real time reflections of the best data we have, not necessarily the current Go To Market approach.
Requests to override the TSP information can also be submitted in the Account Review section of the account.

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>Operators Guide: Territory Success Planning (TSP) </summary>

**Primary TSP Workflow Components**
 1. **Account Routing** (*Next Owner recommendation process*):
     * Sales Segment (i.e. max employee count of the account hierarchy)
     * Primary Account HQ Address (of top Parent Account in the hierarchy)
         * Inputs for both are formulated via our standardized account enrichment tools (in order):
         * Manual Override > DataFox > DiscoverOrg > Ship-To > Bill-To
    * LeadData then compares these TSP Input Values against our [SSoT Territory Mapping File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=720021722) & automatically outputs an Approved Next Owner and Territory.
2. **Account Assignment** (*Account Transfer Process*):
     * (Re)Assignment of an account to the correct owner
     * Updating of Account Territory, Sales Segment, Employees fields

**Firmographic TSP Fields**
   * `[TSP] Sales Segment`: Segment of the account based on the MAX employee count in that account's hierarchy (regardless if MAX is parent or child).
   *  `[TSP] Account Employees`: Number of employees **for this specific account** 
   *  `[TSP] MAX Family Employees`:  MAX employee count (number) in hierarchy
   *  `[TSP] Address (Street, City, State, Post Code, Country)`: Location of Ultimate Parent Account based on the TSP data hierarchy
   *  `[TSP] Geo Story`: Source of address data from TSP Data Hierarchy

**Ownership TSP Fields**
   * `[TSP] Next Approved Owner`: Owner of territory as determined by [SSoT Territory Mapping File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=720021722)
   * `[TSP] Transfer Date`: Date when account ownership will change to `TSP Next Approved Owner`

**Territory TSP Fields**
   * `[TSP] Territory`: Territory account falls under, as per the [SSoT Territory Mapping File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=720021722)
   * `[TSP] Region`: Sales territory region the account falls under
   * `[TSP] Subregion`: Sales territory sub-region the account falls under
   * `[TSP] Area`: Sales territory area the account falls under
  
</details> 

### **What if TSP is wrong? How can I request a change?**

In the event our data enrichment tools are outdated or incorrect (primary address or employee count), you can submit a request to override this information.

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>Process for Requesting TSP Changes:</summary>

1. **Request Process:**
    *  Enter desired TSP information into the following fields (this can be either Account, Employee Count, or both).
    *  Be sure to include source of correct data (ROE must still be followed)   
          *  `[User Input] Employee Count`
          *  `[User Input] Employee Source`
          *  `[User Input] Address Street`
          *  `[User Input] Address City`
          *  `[User Input] Address State`
          *  `[User Input] Address Post Code`
          *  `[User Input] Address Country`
          *  `[User Input] Address Source`

1.  **Operations Review Process:**
Ops will review these requests on a periodic basis, and provide a response in the `[TSP] Override Status` field:
    *  **Approved** - Account changes accepted, & `[TSP] Effective Date` populated by Ops.
    *  **Rejected** - Reason added to `[TSP] Decision Rationale` field.
    *  **Needs Approval/More Info** - Info needed added to `[TSP] Decision Rationale` field.<p/>
1.  **Execution:**
    *  Turnaround time for Approved TSP changes to re-populate typically takes 24-48 hours.
    *  Accounts with a `[TSP] Effective Date` populated will be re-routed each night to the `[TSP] Next Approved Owner`. 
    *  `Account Territory`, `Sales Segment` & `Employees` fields will also be updated upon TSP transfer, to continually align accounts.

### **Opportunity Splits**

The Sales Operations team supports the opportunity credit split approval process with support from Deal Desk.  Sales Operations also maintains the process and data maintenance for opportunity splits outside of credit splits. A non-credit split is strictly functionality to support correct 100% split allocation to the opportunity owner when a credit split does not apply.  The non-credit splits are automated and the tasks will be to monitor the data for accuracy in Salesforce, ensuring correct data in CaptivateIQ and Clari.

**Opportunity Split Rules**
1. Deal Desk, Sales Comp and Sales Ops are the only users with permissions to add, edit, update and delete splits.
2. 100% Split always goes to the opportunity owner
     * This does not apply for a credit split. Ex: 50/50 or any other percentage split.
     * If the opportunity is incorrectly assigned, the split should still match the owner until correct opportunity assignment is made.
     * This is automated and should be monitored on this [Exception Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oXQt) weekly.
3. There will never be a split that totals above 100%. 
4. SFDC reports and Dashboards will only reflect opportunity splits if the report type includeds opportunity splits. 

**Opportunity Splits in Clari**
   * Clari will pull the split data out of SFDC. 
   
  
**Updating | Adding | Deleting a Split In Salesforce**
1.  Navigate to the opportunity in SFDC.
2.  Locate the opportunity splits relationship by using the hover links at the to or scrolling down the page.
3.  Choose the button to add or edit a split.
4.  Once on the split page, assign either the approved credit split, or edit the existing split percentage.
