## Field Certification Program Overview 
To support and scale GitLab’s continued growth and success, the Field Enablement Team is developing a role based certification program that includes functional, soft skills, and technical training for field team members.  

Certification badges will align to the customer journey and critical “Moments That Matter” (MTMs) as well as the [field functional competencies](/handbook/sales/training/field-functional-competencies/) that address the critical knowledge, skills, role-based behaviors, processes, content, and tools to successfully execute each MTM.

### Purpose of the Field Certification Program
Certification programs allow us to validate GitLab skills and knowledge, recognize individual mastery, and motivate continuous learning and skills growth all aligned to expectation setting and performance discussions.

The goal of the Field Certification Program is to validate that:
* Knowledge has been transferred (Do you know it?)
* The learner can apply that knowledge in simulated & live scenarios (Can you do it?)
* The learner has taken ownership of effective skill execution and can demonstrate proficiency over time (Can you do it independently and continue to execute over time?)

### Audience 
The Field Certification Program will include functional and soft skills training for:
* [Strategic Account Leaders](/handbook/sales/training/field-certification/sal/)
* [Account Executives](/handbook/sales/commercial/enablement/required7/)  
* [Solution Architects](/handbook/sales/training/field-certification/sa/)  
* [Technical Account Managers](/handbook/sales/training/field-certification/tam/)

### Moments That Matter (MTM)
Moments That Matter are episodes where a field team member creates engagements with a customer that make a lasting emotional impression on how they feel about them.
They are based on the concept explained in "Blueprints for a SAAS Sales Organization: How to Design, Build and Scale a Customer Centric Sales Orgnization" by Jacob Van Der Kooj and Fernando Pizarro. 

Please note: The GitLab Moments That Matter continue to evolve. To see that latest, please check out the slide below.

## Delivery 
Course content will be a combination of handbook pages, YouTube videos, and interactive content delivered through the new Learning Experience Platform (LXP). This new system is not intended to replace the Handbook as the single source of truth, and instead will serve to curate content from a variety of sources and provide a guided tour of curated content for the learner. 

### Certification Assessments
To achieve GitLab “certified” status, candidates must complete both the online written exam (knowledge) and practical assessment (skill) with a passing score on each exam.
* Anyone can sign up and take the written exam but only candidates who successfully pass the online written exam will be granted access to the practical assessment
* The practical assessment will require team members to demonstrate the ability to perform Moments that Matter to GitLab’s standards 

## Roadmap
Alpha testing for the below courses will take place in FY21Q3:
- Pipeline Generation & Qualification for Strategic Account Leaders
- The Required 7 for Account Executives 
- Delivering Value-Driven Demos for Solutions Architects
- Onboarding the Customer for Technical Account Managers 

The first courses are scheduled to go live in conjunction with the launch of our Learning Experience Platform (LXP) in FY21Q4.
