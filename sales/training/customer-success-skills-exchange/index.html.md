# Customer Success Skills Exchange Sessions

## Upcoming Training
To see what training is coming soon, view the [Customer Success Skills Exchange Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/cs-skills-exchange/-/boards/1414538).

### Get an invite to the weekly session

To get a calendar invite to the weekly CS Skills Exchange, make sure you are added to the sales-cs email group

You can [fill out an access request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/) to request access to the email group. These groups are invited to the meeting so that each individual person does not need an invite.

## How the CS Skills Exchange runs

* Each training session has a [speaker](#speaker-responsibilities) and a [moderator](#moderator-responsibilities)
* Sessions are 60 minutes long
* The presentation portion should be 20 minutes leaving 40 minutes for discussion and Q&A

* Record the call to your local computer.

> For today's GitLab CS Skills Exchange training we are pleased to have `<speaker name>` talk to us about `<topic>`. With that, I'd like to pass it over to `<speaker name>`
