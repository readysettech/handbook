The Purchase Order Process isn't live yet but you can read about what it will entail before the go-live date in this page

## When do I need to create a purchase order? 
If your contract has an annual value of $100K or greater, a Purchase Order (PO) must be created to pay your vendor. If an invoice is received that is at or above $100K and there is no PO, the invoice will not be paid until a PO is created which could cause delays to your vendor's receipt of payment.

## Before the Purchase Order is created

It is the responsibility of the business owner/issue creator to request a Purchase Order be generated. To do this, complete the steps below within the vendor contract request issue. Once these steps are completed, a PO will be generated by the procurement team:

1. After the contract has been through the approvals process and signed by **both** parties, attach it to the issue in the appropriate step.
     - A PO will not be created until the signed contract is uploaded to the issue in the appropriate step. The request will be rejected and delayed until the contract is uploaded.
     - A PO will not be created unless all approvals have been received in the contract request issue and your vendor will not be paid.
1. Enter the contract start and end date
     - A PO will not be created until these dates are added to the issue in the appropriate step. The request will be rejected and delayed until this is entered.
1. Add the `PO To-Do` label to the issue. This prompts the PO creation process. 
     - A PO will not be created until this label is added to the issue. The request will not be seen and the PO will not be created until this tag is added.
1. Enter the Invoice Approver name. This is the person who will approve and be contacted in the event there are any invoice questions.
     - If no invoice approver name is entered, the PO will default to the person who opened the issue. In the event this is the incorrect person, payment to the vendor may be delayed.

## Creation of the Purchase Order

Once a Vendor issue has completed the [Procure to Pay Process](/handbook/finance/procure-to-pay), a Purchase Order is created in Netsuite by the procurement team. Before the Purchase Order can be completed, the vendor must self register/setup within Tipalti. Any delay in the Vendor Setup process will delay payment to the Vendor. Refer to [Vendor Master Management](/handbook/finance/accounting/#3-vendor-master-management) for the Vendor set up process.

Detailed Guide with screen shots is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iJQHbG1qBFwwis8i_-dtytMP2HY8MNg8rxAH0VS2L3E/edit#).

## Update the Vendor Contract Issue after PO has been created
Once a purchase order has been created and submitted in Netsuite, the below steps have to be followed to complete the process:
1. Add the Purchase Order number to the comments section of the Vendor Contract Issue.
1. Attach the Purchase Order PDF to the comments section of the Vendor Contract Issue.
1. Add the label “PO-Done” to the Vendor Contract Issue.

## PO Change Approval request

If you receive an email notifying that a bill could not be approved due to exceptions during the matching process, start working with the Procurement team by opening a PO Change Approval issue to request the change of an existing Purchase Order. This can include an increase or decrease in the dollar amount or any changes to the currency, product, etc. Procurement will not approve the request if the request is incomplete and/or missing information.

Contact Procurement directly in Slack via #procurement if you have questions.

###  Opening a PO Change Approval issue

1.  The Business Owner / Requestor has to open a PO Change Approval issue with [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/issues/new?issuable_template=PO_Change_Approval) to begin the process.
1.  Once the change has been approved by all parties, the Procurement team will amend the Purchase Order in NetSuite.
2.  The Business Owner / Requestor has to send the bill back to Accounts Payable (either by logging into Tipalti or directly clicking on the button "Send back to AP" from the email) and notify that the PO has been amended by adding the PO Change Approval issue URL.
    *  **If the bill is not sent back to AP by the Business Owner, the process will not move forward and the invoice won't be paid.**
