   - Log into https://customers.gitlab.com/admin
   - Go to `Customers` search page by clicking on `Customers` on the left panel
   - Search for customer using one of the following: email, domain, or First/Last name (in case customer registered with a different email)
   - Click on one of the info, pencil, or person icon in the result
   - Take the customer ID from the URL https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer/customerID/pagepath
1. Finding the errror message for the customer in Sentry:
   - Go to https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/
   - Use `user:customerID` (replace `customerID` with the actual customerID from customer portal)
   - Open sentry issue â†’ Click on `EVENTS`
   - Use customer email to search for the relevant event
