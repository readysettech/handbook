### Overview

The admin note serves as a quick reference for any account changes or action performed on a GitLab.com account. It also helps to determine if the user was previously flagged for any violations to prevent any further abuse.

If you encounter a situation with the following cases, an admin note is required.

- User requested change
- Legal case
- Security or Abuse case

### Adding the Note

To add the admin note, simply go to the user profile in the admin page of GitLab.com in the section of Admin Notes:

In general, the formatting should be standard in a one liner format:

- Violation: `Date | Note | Case | Link`
- Action Taken: `Date | Note | Case | Link`

Slack conversations or Issue links may be used for the link if no ticket is lodged for the type of request.
